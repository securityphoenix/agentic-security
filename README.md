## What you get

<img src="docs/brand/patch-alert.svg" align="right" width="120" alt="Patch · ALERT — finding detected">

```
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  ❌  Not safe to deploy  ·  api-billing
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
   3 critical · 8 high · 22 medium · 41 advisory
   🔥 2 actively exploited in the wild (CISA KEV)
   ✓  1 CONFIRMED (PoC built by /triage --validate)

   [critical] SQL Injection                api/users.ts:42
     Could leak PII for ~5,000 users.
     Estimated cost if exploited: $125k–$1.3M
     Fix:  use parameterized query — db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?', [id])

   [critical] Hardcoded Stripe live key    src/lib/billing.ts:7
     Could enable fraudulent charges against your account.
     Estimated cost if exploited: $50k–$500k (chargebacks + Stripe fees)
     Fix:  rotate via /agentic-security:fix --rotate-secret --auto, then move to env var

   [critical] Missing webhook signature    api/stripe-webhook.ts:12
     Anyone can POST a fake "payment.succeeded" and unlock paid features.
     Estimated cost if exploited: cost of a free subscription × every attacker
     Fix:  stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(rawBody, signature, endpointSecret)

   How many do you want to fix?
     1. Critical only           (3 fixes)
     2. Critical + High         (11 fixes)
     3. Critical + High + Medium (33 fixes)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

No CVE jargon. The stakes, the cost, the fix.

## Install

In **Claude Code** (recommended) — two steps:

```
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/Clear-Capabilities/agentic-security
/plugin install agentic-security@clearcapabilities
```

The first command registers the marketplace as a source; the second actually installs the plugin. Then restart Claude Code (or `/reload-plugins`). To update later: `/plugin marketplace update clearcapabilities` followed by `/plugin install agentic-security@clearcapabilities`.

In your **terminal** (no Claude Code required):

```bash
npx @clear-capabilities/agentic-security-scanner secure .
```

Also works with Codex, Cursor, and Gemini CLI — [harness setup](docs/HARNESS_COMPATIBILITY.md).

## Ten commands

![agentic-security demo](docs/brand/demo.gif)

**`/agentic-security:secure`** — Router. Picks the single best next action from project state. Also: `--tour`, `--help`, `--daily`.

**`/agentic-security:find-and-fix-everything`** — One-shot scan + fix every severity in one command. The vibecoder "just make it safe" path.

**`/agentic-security:scan`** — Run the scanner. Modes: full / diff / watch / baseline / archaeology / scanner-meta.

**`/agentic-security:triage`** — Decide on findings. Modes: id / show / explain / validate / tournament / red-team / exploit / query.

**`/agentic-security:fix`** — Remediation. Modes: id / all / pr / sca / compliance / rotate-secret / vault / harden / trim / generate.

**`/agentic-security:posture`** — Posture + reporting. Modes: status / report-card / harness / trend / threat / playbook / mgmt.

**`/agentic-security:compliance`** — Compliance + auditor flows. Modes: report / walkthrough / attestation / audit / pr.

**`/agentic-security:supply`** — Supply chain. Modes: check / sbom / cve-alerts / license.

**`/agentic-security:setup`** — Workflow installers + guards. Modes: hooks / ci / bodyguard / destructive-guard.

**`/agentic-security:labs`** — Experimental + AI-driven. Modes: claude-audit / model-rescan / synthesize-rule / cross-repo / risk-dollars / time-to-fix / llm.

Every legacy capability is reachable as a mode of one of these dispatchers — run `/secure --help` for the full surface.

## Compliance frameworks

`/compliance --report <framework>` generates an auditor-ready attestation that scans your project against:

| Framework | `<framework>` | Coverage map |
|---|---|---|
| NIST AI 600-1 (2024) — Generative AI Profile | `nist` | [coverage](docs/compliance/nist-ai-600-1-coverage.md) |
| OWASP ASVS 4.0.3 — Application Security Verification Standard | `asvs` | [coverage](docs/compliance/owasp-asvs-coverage.md) |
| OWASP LLM Top 10 (2025) | `llm` | [coverage](docs/compliance/owasp-llm-top10-coverage.md) |
| EU AI Act | `eu-ai-act` | [`scripts/eu-ai-act/`](scripts/eu-ai-act/) |

`/compliance --walkthrough <framework>` adds step-by-step auditor narratives with per-control evidence mapping for `nist-csf-2`, `nist-ai-600-1`, `owasp-asvs-5`, `owasp-llm-top-10`, `eu-ai-act`, `gdpr`, `hipaa-security-rule`, and `ccpa` — or bring your own controls at `.agentic-security/compliance/<id>/controls.json`.

## What makes it different

- **Plain-English findings with dollar-cost estimates.** Best/likely/worst-case exposure, grounded in IBM Cost of a Data Breach 2024 and 25+ public settlement records. Not CVE numbers.
- **Intercepts insecure AI-generated code before it hits disk.** The `/setup --bodyguard` hook blocks SQLi via concat, hardcoded API keys, `eval` on user input, and more — in real time, as your AI writes.
- **12-pillar scan in one command.** SAST, SCA, secrets, IaC, LLM safety, MCP agent-tool audit, auth/authZ, pipeline integrity, containers, deploy config, supply chain, and trend tracking.
- **Function-level reachability across every dependency.** OSV ecosystem_specific parsing, GHSA fix-commit analysis, vendored code fingerprinting, Java IR call-graph matching, and LLM-assisted function extraction — not just a hardcoded hints list.
- **SCA reachability tiers.** Every dependency classified as `function-reachable`, `import-reachable`, `build-only`, `manifest-only`, or `transitive-only` — so you fix what matters.
- **CISA KEV + EPSS prioritization.** Separates "this could theoretically be bad" from "people are running scripts that exploit this today."
- **SARIF codeFlows for taint traces.** Multi-step source-to-sink paths rendered natively in GitHub Code Scanning, DefectDojo, and VS Code SARIF Viewer.
- **One-command fix with preview.** Every patch previewed before write, backed up, revertible. The fixer reads your stack so patches match your code style.
- **Auto-baseline for legacy codebases.** `--set-baseline` snapshots existing findings; `--since-baseline` shows only what's new. Day-one usable on any project.

## What this is NOT

- **Not a SaaS dashboard.** It's a CLI + Claude Code plugin.
- **Not a replacement for a pentester.** Static analysis catches patterns; humans catch business-logic flaws. The `security-logic-reviewer` subagent and `/triage --validate` close part of the gap, not all of it.
- **Not magic.** It can miss novel vulnerabilities, especially anything that requires understanding intent.
- **Not free for resale.** PolyForm Internal Use license. Use it to make your own code safe and secure. Don't repackage it as a competing scanner.
