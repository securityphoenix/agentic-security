# agentic-security

**The security layer for AI-written code.**

You're shipping fast. Your AI writes great code, most of the time. But every so often it glues user input straight into a SQL query, hardcodes an API key, or copies a pattern that was already vulnerable. Two weeks later you get a security report — or a *very* angry email.

`agentic-security` watches every edit, surfaces new vulnerabilities the moment they're introduced, and fixes them — same session, same agent, before you've moved on.

```
You:              Add a /search endpoint that queries products by name.
Claude:           (writes code — one query glues user input straight into SQL)
agentic-security: ⚠ 1 new high-severity finding from this edit
                  [HIGH] CWE-89 SQL Injection (routes/products.js:42)
You:              /agentic-security:security-fix-all --severity high
Claude:           (rewrites to parameterized query, re-runs scan, finding gone)
```

## Installation

### Claude Code

```
/plugin marketplace add clearcapabilities/agentic-security
/plugin install agentic-security@clearcapabilities
```

When prompted for installation scope, choose **"Install for you (user scope)"** — this makes the plugin available across all your projects without reinstalling.

Then reload the plugin registry:

```
/reload-plugins
```

Then run this once in each project you want to use the shorter command forms:

```
/agentic-security:security-setup
```

That's it. The short forms (`/security-scan-all`, `/security-fix-all`, etc.) will now work in this project alongside the always-available fully-qualified forms.

## What's inside

**Commands**
- **security-scan-all** — full sweep: SAST + SCA + secrets + IaC
- **security-fix** — patch one finding, adapted to your code by the fixer subagent
- **security-fix-all** — batch remediation at a severity threshold
- **security-baseline** — save/diff a baseline so only new findings surface
- **security-report** — self-contained interactive HTML report (also: JSON, Markdown, SARIF)
- **security-sca** — dependency CVE scan only
- **security-secrets** — credential leak scan only
- **security-setup** — install project shortcuts (run once per project)

**Subagents**
- **security-fixer** — reads context, adapts fix templates to your actual code, runs your tests
- **security-triager** — dedupes, scores exploitability, and ranks a finding list for human review
- **sca-malware-analyst** — CLEAN / SUSPICIOUS / MALICIOUS verdict on dependencies using strict grounding rules

**Skills** (auto-trigger based on what you're doing)
- **sast-scan** — activates when you ask "is this safe?" or generate new code
- **sca-scan** — activates when you add/change a dependency or mention a CVE
- **secret-scan** — activates before publishing or when you touch a config file
- **fix-vulnerability** — activates when you ask Claude to fix a security issue

**Hooks** (always on)
- **PostToolUse** — scans the file after every edit; surfaces new high/critical findings inline
- **PreToolUse** — blocks `git commit` if new critical findings exist vs. baseline
- **SessionStart** — reminds you to set a baseline if none exists

## Tutorial: Fix a deliberately broken app

[**OWASP Juice Shop**](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop) is an app *intentionally* full of security holes, used to teach hacking. We'll point the scanner at it, find a few hundred real bugs, fix the worst ones, and watch the score drop.

**Step 1 — grab the app**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop ~/code/juice-shop
cd ~/code/juice-shop
```

**Step 2 — open Claude Code in the cloned repo**

```bash
claude ~/code/juice-shop
```

**Step 3 — scan it**

```
/agentic-security:security-scan-all
```

```
Scan Complete — 296 Findings Across 456 Files

  Critical  ~35   SQL Injection, XSS (DomSanitizer bypasses), IDOR,
                  RCE (VM sandbox), hardcoded RSA key / HMAC secret
  High      ~60   SSRF, Path Traversal, NoSQL Injection, SSTI,
                  JWT bypass, race conditions, SCA CVEs
                  (jsonwebtoken, express-jwt, multer, sequelize)
  Medium   ~100   No rate limiting on auth endpoints, permissive CORS (*),
                  weak randomness, cookie flags, open redirects, timing oracles
  Low/Info  rest  Sync I/O, pagination limits, TODO markers
```

296 confirmed findings, pre-triaged. False positives filtered before you see a single result.

**Step 3 — get a report**

```
/agentic-security:security-report
open security-report.html
```

A self-contained interactive page: severity chart, filterable finding list, fix templates per finding, STRIDE attack coverage overview. One file — email it, attach to a Jira ticket, drop in Slack.

**Step 4 — fix the worst stuff**

```
/agentic-security:security-fix-all --critical
```

Before touching any code, Claude will read the findings and summarise what it's about to change. On a well-known codebase like Juice Shop it will flag that the vulnerabilities are intentional challenges and ask how to proceed. Tell it:

```
please remove all critical vulns. yes i understand juice shop has purposely built vulns but remove all critical vulns anyways
```

Claude then works through each finding in sequence — parameterized queries instead of string concatenation, `bcrypt` instead of MD5, `execFile` instead of `exec`. Each fix is a normal edit you can review or revert. It runs serially because fixing one bug can change another.

**Step 5 — lock in your progress**

```
/agentic-security:security-baseline save
```

From now on, scans only show *new* findings added after this point. The pre-commit hook blocks any commit that introduces new critical bugs.

**Step 6 — generate the after-report, compare**

```
/agentic-security:security-report --output after.html
open after.html
```

Put `before.html` and `after.html` side by side. In less than 20 minutes you went from 35 critical findings to 0.

## What it catches

| Vulnerability | What goes wrong |
|---|---|
| **SQL injection** | `' OR 1=1` reads your entire user table |
| **Hardcoded secrets** | Stripe key ends up on GitHub; $4,000 fraud bill |
| **XSS** | A comment runs JS in every visitor's browser, steals sessions |
| **Path traversal** | User requests `../../../etc/passwd`; server serves it |
| **Command injection** | A search box runs shell commands on your server |
| **Weak password storage** | MD5 passwords cracked in minutes after a breach |
| **Vulnerable dependencies** | An `npm install` from months ago has an RCE CVE |
| **Misconfigured infra** | Terraform/Dockerfile/K8s accidentally exposes data publicly |

40+ vulnerability types. Code, dependencies, secrets, and infrastructure files.

**Languages:** JS, TypeScript, Python, PHP, Ruby, Java, Go, Vue, React, Angular, Svelte.
**Dependency manifests:** npm, yarn, pnpm, pip, poetry, Pipfile, composer, Gemfile, go.mod, Cargo, Maven, Gradle, pubspec — 20 formats.
**Infrastructure:** Dockerfile, docker-compose, Kubernetes, Terraform, Helm, GitHub Actions.

## What makes it different

**Triage is built in, not bolted on.** Findings are deduplicated, scored, and FP-filtered before you see a single result. Every finding gets an exploitability score (0–100) based on whether it's reachable from a route handler, whether the source is HTTP-facing, and how critical the sink class is. Findings are sorted by score, not just severity label.

**Context-aware false-positive suppression.** Most scanners flag `crypto.createHash('md5')` as a critical password-hashing issue regardless of context. We classify it by surrounding variable names — a cache key or ETag is info-level; a password field is critical. For IDOR, we check whether the lookup uses an auth-derived ownership clause in the WHERE, or whether a post-lookup comparison (`basket.UserId !== customer.id`) with a guard (`throw` / `res.status(403)`) exists nearby — if so, it's not flagged. For XSS, `element.innerHTML === value` (comparison) is distinguished from `element.innerHTML = value` (assignment). For secrets, SQL template literals, OAuth URL fragment keys, and values in `codefixes/`, `test/`, or `fixtures/` paths are suppressed automatically. Sanitizer return values are tracked: `escapeHtml(input); res.send(input)` (return discarded) is still flagged.

**Forward-only taint flow.** The taint engine enforces direction — a source defined *after* the sink cannot create a phantom finding. Cross-file taint tracks up to 5 hops (BFS), following imports and call chains across files and showing the full propagation path.

**CVEs ranked by real-world exploitation.** Every CVE gets an [EPSS](https://www.first.org/epss/) score — the probability it's being actively exploited in the next 30 days. Two CVEs both labeled "high" might have `epssScore: 0.87` vs. `epssScore: 0.02`. Fix the right one first.

**Your code never leaves your machine.** The only network calls are to OSV.dev (dependency CVE lookups) and first.org (EPSS scores). We send only `package@version` strings to OSV — no source code, no file paths.

---

## Philosophy

- **Fix, don't just report** — findings come with canonical fix templates and a subagent that applies them
- **Signal over noise** — false-positive suppression by context, not just by rule
- **Local-first** — one file, no cloud dependency, no code upload
- **Ratchet, don't boil the ocean** — baseline + gate means you improve incrementally without getting paralyzed by legacy debt

---

## FAQ

**Will this work on my codebase?**
JS, TS, Python, PHP, Ruby, Java, Go, and most web frameworks — yes. Plus infra files.

**Does it run in the cloud?**
No. Scanner runs on your machine. OSV.dev gets only package names + versions.

**What if I disagree with a finding?**
Add a suppression to `.agentic-security/rules.yml`:
```yaml
suppressions:
  - rule: "MD5/SHA1 Password Hashing"
    files: ["legacy/auth-v1.js"]
    reason: "Migrating to bcrypt in Q3; JIRA-1234"
```

**Can I add custom rules?**
Yes — sources, sinks, and sanitizers in the same `rules.yml`:
```yaml
sinks:
  - pattern: 'db\.executeRaw\('
    vuln: 'SQL Injection (Custom)'
    severity: high
```

**My CI says "319 findings."**
That's a real codebase. Run `/agentic-security:security-baseline save`, commit the baseline file, and from now on you only see *new* problems.

**How is this different from `npm audit`?**
`npm audit` flags every CVE in your tree, including ones in code paths you never call. We filter by vulnerable-call-depth. Also covers 19 other manifest formats besides npm.

## Troubleshooting

**Short-form commands disappear mid-session** — Claude Code can evict plugin commands from the active session after long-running tool calls (large scans, multi-file fixes). Two options:
- Run `/reload-plugins` to restore all short-form commands for the rest of the session.
- Use the fully-qualified form instead: `/agentic-security:security-fix-all`, `/agentic-security:security-scan-all`, etc. — these resolve through the plugin skill system and are always available.

## GitHub Actions

```yaml
# .github/workflows/security.yml
name: Security
on:
  pull_request: {}
  push: { branches: [main] }

jobs:
  security:
    permissions:
      contents: read
      security-events: write
      pull-requests: write
    uses: clearcapabilities/agentic-security/.github/workflows/scan.yml@main
    with:
      fail-on: critical
      baseline: ${{ github.event.pull_request.base.sha || 'HEAD~1' }}
```

Every PR gets a comment with severity counts and the top findings. Critical findings block merge.

> If CI fails with `"requesting 'pull-requests: write' but only allowed 'none'"` — the `permissions:` block above is required.
