## Build & test

```bash
cd scanner/
npm install
npm run build          # bundles dist/agentic-security.mjs via @vercel/ncc; emits a SHA-256 sidecar
npm test               # full CI gate (chains the scoped scripts below)
npm run test:smoke     # one-file fixture, fast
npm run test:sast      # SAST detector tests
npm run test:dataflow  # IR + taint engine + calibration + held-out eval
npm run test:mcp       # MCP server + audit log
npm run smoke          # bundle smoke: CLI vs vulnerable-js fixture
```

All scoped scripts are defined in `scanner/package.json`. Pick the one closest to what you touched; `scanner/CLAUDE.md` documents which test files are in which scope.

After any change to `scanner/src/` or `scanner/bin/`, run `npm run build` before relying on the bundle. Unit tests run against `src/` directly and do not require a rebuild.

## Key conventions (the things you'll get wrong without reading them)

- **ESM throughout.** All `scanner/src/` files use `import`/`export`. No CommonJS in the scanner tree.
- **No runtime cloud calls.** OSV/KEV/EPSS data is fetched lazily and disk-cached under `~/.claude/agentic-security/osv-cache/`. New network dependencies must be opt-in and degrade gracefully when offline.
- **Findings schema.** Every finding must include `{ id, severity, file, line, vuln, cwe, description, remediation, parser, family }`. Severity values: `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, `info`. Phase-1 extends with `stableId`, `confidence` + `confidenceTier`, `exploitability` + `exploitabilityTier` + `exploitabilityFactors[]`, optionally `clusterSize` / `exampleFlows[]`, and `unreachable:true` for reachability-demoted. `parser` + `family` are required — `posture/finding-defaults.js` backfills, but detector-set values win.
- **Suppression pragma.** `// agentic-security-ignore: <rule-id>` on the offending line.
- **Rules override is gated.** `.agentic-security/rules.yml` `disable:` entries take effect only when a sibling `.sig` verifies under the per-install HMAC key, or `AGENTIC_SECURITY_RULES_UNSIGNED=1` is set. `severityOverrides`, `custom:`, and `ignorePaths` are not gated (they don't reduce coverage).
- **last-scan.json integrity.** Each write is accompanied by a `.sig` (HMAC-SHA256). The key is per-install (32 random bytes at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/agentic-security/scan-key`, mode 0600) — NOT the hostname. Override via `$AGENTIC_SECURITY_HMAC_KEY` (hex).
- **Calibration is held-out-only.** The seed corpus is for *fitting* the calibration table; never compute Brier/ECE against the same labels. Use `posture/holdout-eval.js` with a separate JSONL.
- **Bench-shape isolation.** Answer-key reading (Juliet folder names, OWASP template markers) lives under `sast/bench-shape/` and is OFF by default. `AGENTIC_SECURITY_BENCH_SHAPE=1` enables; `AGENTIC_SECURITY_BLIND_BENCH=1` overrides to force off.
- **Shadow mode.** Custom rules with `shadow: true` write to `.agentic-security/shadow-findings.json` and are excluded from CI gates — for experimental rules not yet ready to block.
- **Test fixtures.** New rules need a minimal `vulnerable/` + `clean/` pair under `scanner/test/fixtures/<rule-name>/`. Smoke must detect in `vulnerable/`, must pass on `clean/`.

## Adding a new scan rule

See the **`scanner/src/sast/CLAUDE.md`** local guide. (Moved out of root per the Claude-Code-at-scale guidance: reusable expertise belongs next to the code it applies to, not in the every-session root file.)

The skill `skills/add-scan-rule.md` packages the same workflow for on-demand invocation outside the repo (e.g. from a downstream consumer's session).

## Claude Code integration

- **Plugin manifest:** `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — registers the MCP server, hooks, agents, and slash commands.
- **Settings:** `.claude/settings.json` (committed) defines the team's read-deny list — generated bundles, cached benches, scan-state JSON. Override locally via `.claude/settings.local.json` (gitignored).
- **Commands:** markdown files in `commands/` — one per slash command. Index in `commands/help.md`.
- **Agents:** markdown system prompts in `agents/`. Edit-capable agents (`security-fixer`, `refactor-cleaner`) inherit the path-confinement contract in `agents/_CONFINEMENT.md` — same reserved-write list as the MCP server.
- **Hooks:** `hooks/hooks.json` wires SessionStart / PreToolUse / PostToolUse / Stop. The Stop hook (`hooks/session-stop-drift-check.js`) flags new files in `scanner/src/{sast,posture,dataflow}/` not yet mentioned in the relevant subdir CLAUDE.md.
- **State:** `.agentic-security/last-scan.json` is the canonical scan output consumed by every downstream command.
- **MCP server:** see `scanner/src/mcp/CLAUDE.md` for tool inventory and hardening posture.

## Premortem-derived guardrails

Source comments tagged `(premortem #N)` cross-reference the adversarial-review thread that motivated the change. To find the full set: `git log --grep='premortem'` for commit context, or `grep -rn "premortem #" scanner/src/` for in-code anchors. Living guardrails (the ones future contributors will get wrong without reading) are codified in **Key conventions** above, not here — this section is intentionally short so it doesn't rot.
