## Why you need this

Your AI is fast. It's also writing security bugs.

This morning Claude wrote your login route in 9 seconds. Beautiful code. Tests pass.

It also lets anyone in the world log in as admin with a single line of curl.

You don't know this yet. Neither does Claude.

**One command finds it. One command fixes it.**

That command lives inside Claude Code, runs locally on your laptop, and explains every finding in plain English.

---

## Install

In **Claude Code** (recommended — gets you the slash commands):

```
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/clearcapabilities/agentic-security
```

That's it. Type `/scan --all` to confirm it's working.

For **CI, terminal, or any project anywhere** (no Claude Code required):

```bash
npx @clearcapabilities/agentic-security-scanner scan .
```

The scanner runs entirely on your machine. Nothing leaves your laptop. No signups, no API keys, no cloud.

---

## Two modes. One tool.

Both modes run the same engine. They differ in how much you see and how much you can configure.

### 🎨 Easy Mode

Three commands. The whole product. The default for everyone.

---

#### `/scan --all` — daily, before deploy

**What `/scan --all` scans every run — nine pillars, no configuration required:**

```
       Pillar         What we scan
       ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
       SAST           Taint analysis (regex + AST for JS/TS), Java
                      rule pack, Python helpers.
       SCA            OSV + CISA KEV + EPSS, function-level
                      reachability, dep confusion, typosquat.
       Secrets        50+ credential patterns, high-entropy heuristic,
                      allowlist-aware.
       IaC            Dockerfile, docker-compose, GitHub Actions,
                      Kubernetes manifests.
       LLM            OWASP LLM Top 10 (2025): prompt injection,
                      sensitive disclosure, supply chain, data/model
                      poisoning, improper output handling, excessive
                      agency, system prompt leakage, vector & embedding
                      weakness, misinformation prompts, unbounded
                      consumption. Benchmarked against AIGoat + LLMGoat.
       MCP            Agent-tool audit for over-privileged MCP servers.
       Pipeline       GitHub Actions integrity: floating tags,
                      secret echoes, OIDC misconfig.
       Auth/AuthZ     Broken access control, IDOR, mass assignment,
                      session fixation.
       Container      Base-image EOL, exposed ports, runtime mode.
```

A one-screen verdict. Either you're safe to ship, or you have a short list of things to fix.

```
─────────────────────────────────────────
  ✅  Safe to deploy
─────────────────────────────────────────
```

…or, when there's work to do:

```
─────────────────────────────────────────
  ❌  Not safe to deploy
─────────────────────────────────────────
  • 31 critical · 73 high · 149 advisory

  How many do you want to fix?

     1. Critical only                (31 fixes)
     2. Critical + High              (104 fixes)
     3. Critical + High + Medium     (253 fixes)

  Reply with 1, 2, or 3.

  Or pick a single one:
     /show-findings --all  see every finding in HTML
     /fix --one <id>       fix exactly one
```

The scanner asks which tier you want to fix; reply with the number and `/fix --all` runs the matching `--severity` automatically.

---

#### `/show-findings --all` — interactive HTML report

Writes a self-contained HTML report to `reports/findings-<timestamp>.html` and opens it in your default browser. The report has severity charts, a filterable findings list, per-finding evidence with the offending code snippet, and the proposed fix template. No external assets, no network required — works offline.

**To view the report:** it usually opens automatically when the command finishes. If it doesn't, open it manually:

```bash
# macOS
open reports/findings-<timestamp>.html

# Linux
xdg-open reports/findings-<timestamp>.html

# Windows
start reports/findings-<timestamp>.html
```

---

#### `/fix --all` — patch findings in batch

Pick a severity tier; `/fix --all` dispatches the security-fixer agent on every finding at or above it. Tiers are **cumulative** — `/fix --all --high` patches critical **+** high. Sequential, test-aware, does not auto-revert on failure.

| Flag | Fixes |
|---|---|
| `/fix --all --critical` (default) | Critical only |
| `/fix --all --high` | Critical + High |
| `/fix --all --medium` | Critical + High + Medium |
| `/fix --all --low` | Everything |

Example — fixing all critical and high-severity findings:

```
> /fix --all --high

Checking git state…   clean ✓
Fixing 104 findings (31 critical + 73 high)…

  ✓  routes/login.ts:34       SQL Injection                → parameterized query
  ✓  lib/insecurity.ts:43     MD5 Password Hashing         → bcrypt (cost 12)
  ✓  routes/b2bOrder.ts:17    RCE via vm.runInContext      → JSON.parse
  ✓  routes/order.ts:35       IDOR                         → ownership check
  …  +100 more

Applied 104 fixes, 0 skipped (tests failed), 0 regressions introduced.
```

That's the entire product. You don't need anything else to ship safer code.

### ⚙️ Developer Mode

> **Full taxonomy. SARIF on every scan. CI gates. Audit-grade suppressions. 13 commands, everything behind flags.**

For platform teams, AppSec engineers, and anyone who needs findings outside a chat window.

Here's what a scan looks like in developer mode:

```
agentic-security — developer mode  ·  258 finding(s) across 412 file(s)

Critical: 31  High: 73  Medium: 149  Low: 5  Info: 0

Machine-readable output written to .agentic-security/findings.{sarif,json,csv}
```

Every finding carries CWE, CVSS, OWASP, MITRE ATT&CK technique, CAPEC pattern, exploitability score, source/sink reachability, and toxic-combinations scoring.
