PROJECT META
  /security-setup            Install short-form commands in this project
  /security-status           Plugin & project health snapshot
  /security-help             This command

USAGE NOTES
  - Every command works as /agentic-security:<name> too (the long form).
  - Most commands accept a [path] argument to limit scope.
  - First run /security-scan-all once. Most other commands read its output
    from .agentic-security/last-scan.json.
  - PostToolUse hook scans every Edit/Write automatically. Throttled per-file
    to one scan / 5s.
  - Set AGENTIC_SECURITY_OFFLINE=1 to skip all outbound calls (OSV, EPSS, KEV).
