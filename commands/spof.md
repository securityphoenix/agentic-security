description: Single-point-of-failure analysis — which auth / sanitizer / CSRF middleware, if removed, exposes the most.
argument-hint: "[--threshold <N>]"

Show the v3 counterfactual report. Each entry is a defensive control whose removal would expose ≥ 3 high+ findings — the brittlest pieces of your defense-in-depth.

```bash

for arg in "$@"; do

## Why this matters

A defensive control that is the SOLE protection between an attacker and ≥ 3 high-severity findings is brittle by definition. Standard SAST does not flag it — it only flags the bugs the control happens to be guarding. This command surfaces the structural risk: where would damage concentrate if ONE control fails?

Typical findings:
- A single `requireAuth` middleware guarding the whole admin surface
- A single `DOMPurify.sanitize` call wrapping every user-content render
- A single signature-verify helper feeding multiple webhook handlers

Mitigation pattern: add defense-in-depth at the route or the sink, not only at the middleware.
