### The Claude Code plugin that catches what your AI coding assistant misses.

> Built by **[Clear Capabilities](https://www.clearcapabilities.com/)**.

---

## The 30-second pitch

This morning, your AI Coding Assistant shipped a new webpage in 9 seconds. Beautiful code. Tests pass.

It also lets anyone in the world log in as admin without even a password and violates data privacy requirements.

You don't know that yet. **Neither does your AI.**

`agentic-security` is the safety net you bolt onto your AI workflow:

- **Find it.** SAST + SCA + secrets + IaC + LLM safety, in one command.
- **Understand it.** Plain-English narrative + cost-of-exploit framing — not CVE jargon.
- **Fix it.** Preview every patch, apply with one command, undo if it breaks anything.

The only thing you give up is the false belief that your AI knew what it was doing.

---

## Install in 30 seconds

In **Claude Code** (recommended — adds 38 slash commands + 11 auto-activating skills):

```
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/Clear-Capabilities/agentic-security
```

Then type `/agentic-security:secure` and let it tell you the next step.

In your **terminal**, anywhere (no Claude Code required):

```bash
npx @clear-capabilities/agentic-security-scanner secure .
```

Same engine. No accounts.

### Other harnesses

The MCP server is harness-agnostic — same binary, different manifest:

| Harness        | Manifest                          | Install path |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|--------------|
| **Claude Code**| `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`      | `/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/Clear-Capabilities/agentic-security` |
| **Codex CLI**  | `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`       | search Codex marketplace for `agentic-security`, then `codex plugin install` (validated against MCP spec; not yet against a live Codex install) |
| **Cursor**     | `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`      | clone repo + point Cursor's MCP config at `scanner/bin/agentic-security-mcp.js` |
| **Gemini CLI** | `gemini-extension.json` (root)    | `gemini extensions install https://github.com/Clear-Capabilities/agentic-security` |

What you get per harness:

- **Claude Code**: full surface — 12 MCP tools, 38 slash commands, 11 auto-activating skills, 4 hooks, 8 subagents, the full audit log + scratchpad + AGENTS.md continual-learning ladder.
- **Codex / Cursor / Gemini**: the 12 MCP tools (deterministic write toolchain, scan, find, lookup) wired directly into the harness's agent. Slash commands + skill activation are Claude-Code-specific today; the underlying MCP behavior is identical across all four harnesses.

If you want a harness not listed here, the MCP server speaks the standard JSON-RPC-over-NDJSON protocol — any MCP-aware client can use it.

   [critical] Missing webhook signature    api/stripe-webhook.ts:12
     Anyone can POST a fake "payment.succeeded" and unlock paid features.
     Estimated cost if exploited: cost of a free subscription × every attacker
     Fix:  stripe.webhooks.constructEvent(rawBody, signature, endpointSecret)

   How many do you want to fix?
     1. Critical only           (3 fixes)
     2. Critical + High         (11 fixes)

That's the default. No CVE numbers. No CWE jargon. The stakes, the cost, the fix.

When the verdict flips green, you get the **approve** face. When it doesn't, you get **alert**.

The mascot (Patch) reacts to whatever your scan actually said.

## Builder Quickstart

You ship features fast. You don't know what a CWE is. You're scared of pushing prod because last time you accidentally deployed a `console.log` of a Stripe key. You want someone to tell you what's wrong, in English, with the fix.

### Two commands cover 90% of what you need

**`/agentic-security:secure`** — when you don't know what to do.

It looks at your project state and tells you the single best next step. No menu, no choice paralysis.

```
🛡  agentic-security · next step

  Action:  fix-critical
  Why:     2 critical finding(s) open. Preview each fix, then --apply.
  Run:     agentic-security fix --finding <id> --preview
```

**`/agentic-security:find-and-fix-everything`** — when you have 10 minutes before lunch.

Runs `/scan --all` then immediately `/fix --all --low` — finds and fixes everything at every severity in one shot. The security-fixer agent reads your auth library, ORM, and framework before writing each fix, so the patches look like the rest of your code.

### Two more vibecoder-shaped commands

**`/agentic-security:scan --uncommitted`** — "what did I just break?" Scans only the files you've changed since your last commit (staged + unstaged + untracked). No git-ref vocabulary, no full-repo wait — same one-screen verdict, scoped to your current edit.

**`/agentic-security:supply-chain-check`** — "is `npm install` safe?" One-screen roll-up across the dep-audit surface (CVE, KEV, pinning, install scripts, vendored code, freshness, alternatives). Pass `--show pinning|freshness|alternatives|install-scripts|vendored` for the per-check view. Replaces the prior six-command surface.

### Why findings are different here

Other scanners give you `[CRITICAL] CWE-89 SQL Injection at api/users.ts:42`. You stare at it, you Google it, you give up.

We give you this:

```
[critical] SQL Injection on api/users.ts:42 (CWE-89)
   Could expose PII for ~5,000 users.
   Context: tech / GDPR + CCPA + PCI-DSS · controls: monitoring, mfa

   Estimated cost if exploited:
     Best   :   $85,000   (contained <24h, internal disclosure)
     Likely :  $620,000   (typical SMB outcome — NetDiligence median)
     Worst  :   $5.2M     (full exfil + class action + max regulatory)

   Component breakdown (likely):
     incident response   :   $50,000
     legal counsel       :  $112,500  (multi-jurisdiction)
     notification        :   $25,000  ($5/user × 5,000)
     credit monitoring   :   $37,500  (PII, 1yr, 30% take-up)
     regulatory fines    :   $87,500  (GDPR + CCPA + PCI bands)
     direct damage       :  $112,000  (per-record × industry mult)
     class action        :   $75,000  (US PII exposure)
     lost business       :  $120,000  (IBM 39% rule)

   Comparable: Equifax 2017 SQLi → $1.4B settlement ($9.50/record)
   Fix:  use a parameterized query
         db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?', [id])
```

**Every finding gets a 4-part framing:**

- **Stakes** — what data, how many users, what industry, what jurisdictions
- **3-point cost** — best (P5) / likely (P50) / worst (P95), not a meaningless range
- **Component breakdown** — IR + legal + notification + credit monitoring + regulatory + damage + class action + churn, each computed separately
- **Comparable incident** — a real public settlement to calibrate against (Equifax, T-Mobile, Capital One, Anthem, etc.)

**Plus two trust signals at the top of the verdict:**

- **🔥 Actively exploited (CISA KEV)** — when one of your findings touches a vulnerability that's on CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog. This is the difference between "this could theoretically be bad" and "people are running scripts that exploit this *today*."
- **✓ CONFIRMED** — when `/validate-findings` has built a working PoC against a finding. Filters the "scanner shouted at me" anxiety from the "this is a real bug I can prove" certainty.

The numbers are grounded in **public data sources**: IBM Cost of a Data Breach 2024 (per-industry, per-record costs), NetDiligence Cyber Claims Study 2024 (SMB distributions), HHS OCR HIPAA enforcement records, GDPR Enforcement Tracker medians, and 25+ public settlement records.

Detected automatically per project: **industry** (14 verticals with IBM 2024 cost multipliers), **jurisdiction exposure** (GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, COPPA, FERPA, NIS2, LGPD, and 8 more), **existing controls** (WAF, MFA, SIEM, encryption, IR plan, bug-bounty, SOC2/ISO27001) that discount the estimate.

This is automatic, on by default. Disable with `--no-blast-radius` if you really want.

### The bodyguards (set once, run forever)

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/agentic-security:ai-bodyguard` | Intercepts insecure AI-generated code BEFORE it hits disk. SQLi via concat, hardcoded API keys, `eval` on user input, `jwt.decode()` without verify, Supabase service-role on the client, LLM call without `max_tokens`. Modes: `off` / `warn` / `block`. |
| `/agentic-security:destructive-guard` | Blocks foot-guns when Claude tries to run them: `rm -rf` on parent dirs, `DROP TABLE`, `git push --force` to main, `curl \| bash`, `chmod 777`, and 8+ more. Plain-English why + safer alternative on every refusal. |
| `/agentic-security:ci --predeploy` | Blocks `vercel --prod` / `fly deploy` / `wrangler publish` / `netlify deploy --prod` / `railway up` when critical findings or KEV-listed deps are present. Hooks into Claude AND your terminal. |
| `/agentic-security:cve-alerts` | Daily Slack/Discord ping when a new CVE drops for any package you use. |
| `/agentic-security:daily-checkin` | Daily security digest to Slack / Discord / generic webhook: what's new since yesterday, what got resolved, which KEV packages landed in your tree. Async awareness without opening a dashboard. |

### The full builder catalog

#### Understand what's wrong (in English)

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/agentic-security:explain` | Plain-English explanation of a finding — what it means, how an attacker abuses it, worst case, fix. |
| `/agentic-security:explain --narrative` | "Meet Mallory. She visits `/api/users`, changes `?id=1` to `?id=2`…" 4-act narrative with attacker, timeline, payloads, fix line. Add `--post-mortem` for past-tense + "what we shipped" block — drop straight into a Notion incident write-up or customer email. |
| `/agentic-security:threat --view surface` | 3–5 realistic attack scenarios written like stories. No CVE IDs. |
| `/agentic-security:risk-in-dollars` | Each finding's best/likely/worst-case $ exposure, sourced from public incident settlements. Cites GDPR / CCPA / HIPAA / NIST AI 600-1 fines. |
| `/agentic-security:report-card` | Single A–F letter grade with one concrete next action. |
| `/agentic-security:tutorial` | First-run walkthrough: picks one real finding from your project, explains it, walks you through fixing it, verifies it. |

#### Fix it, safely

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/agentic-security:fix --all` | Pick a tier (`--critical` / `--high` / `--medium` / `--low`); the security-fixer agent patches each one, sequential, test-aware. |
| `agentic-security fix --finding <id> --preview` | Unified-diff preview before any write. `--apply` writes and backs up the original. |
| `/agentic-security:harden` | One-command hardening: security headers, `.gitignore`, `SECURITY.md`, `npm audit` script. Idempotent. |
| `/agentic-security:rotate-secret` | Detects which provider owns a leaked key, finds every reference, gives platform-specific rotation steps. Add `--scrub-history` to also rewrite git history via `git filter-repo` / BFG. |
| `/agentic-security:rotate-secret --auto` | Goes further: actually revokes, scrubs the value across files, pushes the replacement to Vercel/Fly/Railway/Cloudflare/Netlify env vars via CLI. `--scrub-history` purges git history and writes an audit log to `.agentic-security/rotation-history/`. |
| `/agentic-security:vault-wizard` | Guided migration from `.env` to Doppler, Infisical, or platform-native secrets. |

#### Hardening for the stack you actually use

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/agentic-security:audit --target <area>` | Stack-specific audits: `db`, `auth`, `rate-limit`, `webhook`, `env`, `csp-cors`, `deploy`, `launch`, `llm-cost`, `prompt`. Use `--all` for everything. |
| `/agentic-security:stack-playbook` | Copy-paste security checklist for your exact stack combination. |

#### Things to hand a customer or investor

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/agentic-security:security-attestation` | Shields.io badge for your README + due-diligence-ready security posture paragraph. |
| `/agentic-security:harness-score` | Scores this project's AI agent harness against the six-domain rubric in `docs/HARNESS_ASSESSMENT_SPEC.md`. Emits a four-level domain report with overall = MIN(six). CI-gateable (exits non-zero below `Operating`). |
| `/agentic-security:security-attestation --format onepager` | Customer-facing "How we keep your data safe" page generated from your real posture. PDF-ready. |
| `/agentic-security:generate --type privacy` | Detects every third-party data processor (Stripe, Supabase, Clerk, Sentry, OpenAI, …) and generates a tailored `PRIVACY.md` + cookie-consent component. Jurisdiction-aware. |
| `/agentic-security:security-attestation --format page` | Writes `/.well-known/security.txt` (RFC 9116) + a `/security` page with your live posture. |
| `/agentic-security:generate --type disaster` | Stack-specific `DISASTER.md` with EXACT commands you'll need if you get hacked tomorrow. Bookmark BEFORE the incident. |
| `/agentic-security:generate --type social` | Copy-paste-ready posts (Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Discord/Slack) about your security progress. |

## Pro Quickstart

You triage findings for a living. Most scanners drown you in noise, are impossible to extend, and make every PR review feel like archaeology. You need depth, customization, integration, and audit-defensible output.

### What sets it apart

- **Commercial-grade taint engine.** Field-sensitive access-path lattice + object/receiver sensitivity (CHA + RTA) + higher-order callback propagation + backward slicing + implicit-flow + RHS demand-driven tabulation + SSA + bounded symbolic execution with numeric range domain. Multi-language **Intermediate Representation** — IR is the normalized in-memory graph between source code and analysis, the standard compiler/static-analysis layer; ours covers JS/TS, Python, and Java with one shared shape (CFG + cross-file call graph + class hierarchy + SSA) so the dataflow engine is language-agnostic. Opt-in via `AGENTIC_SECURITY_DEEP=1`. Honest blind-bench: 88.0% F1 on OWASP Benchmark v1.2 strict-blind (no label leakage, identifier-scramble verified).
- **Function-level reachability.** Drops SCA findings whose vulnerable function isn't reachable from any route — kills your noisiest bucket.
- **EPSS-aware prioritization.** Every CVE finding decorated with EPSS score + percentile (FIRST.org). CVEs with percentile ≥ 95% get tagged `exploited-now` and bumped one severity tier so they sort to the top. KEV layered on top.
- **Cross-language taint.** Schema-aware bridges follow flows across HTTP/gRPC/GraphQL/queues/ORM round-trips — OpenAPI + proto + SDL fields paired by structural identity (with synonym detection: `email` ↔ `emailAddress`), not name match.
- **Polyglot embedded-language taint.** Tainted strings inside strings — SQL / JNDI / shell / LDAP / XPath / Mongo / HTML / CSS — recognized even when no obvious sink shape matches (Log4Shell-class detection).
- **MCP server.** 12 tools any MCP-speaking agent (Claude Code / Cursor / Cline / Aider / Codex) can call: `scan_diff`, `query_taint`, `explain_finding`, `find_rule_module`, `lookup_cve`, `synthesize_fix`, `verify_fix`, `apply_fix`, `append_agents_memory`, `read_agents_memory`, `append_scratchpad`, `read_scratchpad`. Hash-chained audit log, session-root pinning, secret redaction, kill switch, code fingerprint — mapped to the OWASP MCP top-10.
- **IDE plugins via LSP.** Same engine powers JetBrains (LSP4IJ), Neovim (native LSP), and VS Code. Inline diagnostics keyed by `stableId` so IDE and CLI reference identical findings.
- **Refactor-stable IDs + confidence + exploitability.** Every finding carries a 16-hex `stableId` (hash of rule + normalized sink signature + path shape), a calibrated `confidence` ∈ [0,1] with tier label, and a composite `exploitability` ∈ [0,1] combining severity + reachability + auth gating + project mitigations + KEV/EPSS.
- **Custom rule DSL.** Semgrep-lite YAML rules in `.agentic-security/rules/*.yml`. `rule test` harness over `vulnerable/` + `clean/` fixtures. `/query` translates natural-language descriptions into the rule DSL.
- **Two-way ticket sync.** GitHub Issues / Linear / Jira. Idempotent state in `.agentic-security/tickets.json`.
- **Deterministic mode.** Byte-stable output + rule-pack lockfile (`rules.lock.json`) for audits and CI baselines.
- **Incremental scans.** Persisted file-hash + per-function summary cache invalidate only changed files + transitive callers — PR-scoped re-analysis is 10× faster on large monorepos.
- **Diff-aware.** `--pr` mode scans only changed files; auto-detects PR base from GitHub / GitLab / Buildkite / Bitbucket env vars.
- **Active-learning loop.** `/triage` verdicts persisted to `.agentic-security/triage-feedback.json`; past FPs by stableId or pattern get suppressed; past TPs get a confidence bump on the next scan.
- **Standards-shaped output.** SARIF, JUnit, CycloneDX (SBOM + ML-BOM + PBOM), SPDX. Drops directly into existing dashboards.

### 5-minute pro setup

```bash
# 1. Flip to pro mode (lowers confidence threshold, shows full taxonomy,
#    writes SARIF + CSV every scan, audit-grade suppression schema).
npx @clear-capabilities/agentic-security-scanner profile set pro

# 2. Lock the rule-pack version for reproducible scans across the team.
npx @clear-capabilities/agentic-security-scanner rules lock

# 3. Wire two-way ticket sync (dry-run first).
npx @clear-capabilities/agentic-security-scanner tickets sync \
   --provider github --severity high --dry-run

# 4. Add a CI gate that fails on critical findings new since the PR base.
npx @clear-capabilities/agentic-security-scanner ci . --fail-on critical

# 5. Generate compliance attestation evidence.
npx @clear-capabilities/agentic-security-scanner scan . --format aibom > ai-bom.json
```

### Status badge for your README

Show the world your repo's security posture. The badge updates every scan; the color shifts to match your highest non-zero severity:

```markdown
![agentic-security](https://agentic-security.dev/badge?repo=YOUR-ORG/YOUR-REPO)
```

Example badges (static previews — the live badge updates from `.agentic-security/last-scan.json` on every scan):

[![agentic-security: passing](https://img.shields.io/badge/agentic--security-passing-brightgreen)]() — clean scan<br>
[![agentic-security: 0 crit · 2 high](https://img.shields.io/badge/agentic--security-crit_0_·_high_2_·_med_5-orange)]() — has high-severity findings<br>
[![agentic-security: critical](https://img.shields.io/badge/agentic--security-crit_1_·_high_3_·_med_8-red)]() — has critical findings

**Self-host the badge** (no `agentic-security.dev` dependency) by serving the output of `agentic-security badge --format svg` from a CI artifact or static site:

```bash
agentic-security badge --format svg > badge.svg
agentic-security badge --format json > badge.json   # shields.io-compatible endpoint
```

Wire `agentic-security badge` into your CI to publish on every scan, and every repo that adopts the badge becomes a billboard pointing at the tool.

### The full pro catalog

#### Deep scanning, validation, and reporting

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/agentic-security:scan` | Full SAST + SCA + secrets sweep. Focused modes: `--sca`, `--secrets`, `--authz`, `--mcp`, `--pipeline`, `--logic`, `--diff`. SARIF + JSON + CSV written every scan. |
| `AGENTIC_SECURITY_DEEP=1 agentic-security scan` | Engage the interprocedural taint engine: IR (Intermediate Representation — the normalized CFG + cross-file callgraph the analyzer walks) + access-paths + receiver-context + higher-order + backward slicing + RHS tabulation + SSA + symbolic-exec + polyglot embeddings. |
| `agentic-security scan --pr [ref]` | Diff-aware: only scan files changed since the PR base. Auto-detects GitHub / GitLab / Buildkite / Bitbucket env vars. |
| `agentic-security scan --deterministic` | Reproducible mode: stable-sorts findings, zeros timing/scanId, forces `--no-network`, verifies `rules.lock.json`. Required for byte-stable CI baselines. |
| `agentic-security rules lock` | Pin the active rule-pack hash + scanner version in `.agentic-security/rules.lock.json`. |
| `/agentic-security:show-findings` | Triage UI. `--all` opens an interactive HTML report. `--kev` filters to weaponized CVEs, `--chains` shows attack chains, `--threat-model [--stride\|--llm]` builds a model. |
| `/agentic-security:validate-findings` | Build a PoC + regression test that proves a vulnerability before fixing. Emits `PROBABLE_FP` when no PoC can be constructed. |
| `/agentic-security:explain --provenance` | Provenance graph for ONE finding — which detector fired, which rule matched, what evidence was present, which suppressions/mitigations were considered. |
| `/agentic-security:explain --gap <CWE>` | Recall spot-check — shows what the engine considered for a CWE in the current scan and explains why no finding was reported. Surfaces catalog gaps. |
| `/agentic-security:scanner --diff` | Run two scanner versions side-by-side and report the delta. Lets you safely preview a scanner upgrade. |
| `/agentic-security:scanner --self-test` | Adversarial self-test: scanner attacks itself by mutating known-vuln fixtures with renaming / wrapping / API-swap strategies. Surfaces detector gaps. |
| `/agentic-security:scanner --baseline` | Finding-level diff between two scan JSON outputs. Useful for "what did this PR introduce?" or "did yesterday's fix actually close it?". |

#### Customization and rule authoring

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `agentic-security rule list \| test <glob>` | Author custom YAML rules in `.agentic-security/rules/*.yml` (regex / `allOf` / `notMatch` / `window`). The `rule test` harness reports PASS / FAIL on `vulnerable/` + `clean/` fixture pairs. |
| `agentic-security rules validate` | Lint `.agentic-security/rules.yml` for schema errors, invalid regex, severity overrides, disabled rules. |
| `agentic-security packs list` | Curated rule packs: `owasp-top-10`, `cwe-top-25`, `llm-security`, `supply-chain`. Activate with `--pack`. |
| `/agentic-security:query` | SentQL — describe a custom check in natural language; the assistant translates it to the project's YAML rule DSL and previews before saving. |
| `/agentic-security:triage` | Interactive triage. Capture true-positive / false-positive / won't-fix verdicts. Persists to `.agentic-security/triage-feedback.json` and feeds the active-learning loop on the next scan. |

#### Integrations and workflow

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `agentic-security tickets sync --provider github\|linear\|jira` | Two-way sync findings ↔ tickets. Creates issues for new findings, closes tickets when findings drop. State in `.agentic-security/tickets.json`. Supports `--dry-run`. |
| `/agentic-security:fix --pr` | Bundle fixes into a feature branch and open a PR. Default dry-run; `--apply` to commit. Skips test-failing fixes; never amends or force-pushes. |
| `/agentic-security:ci` | Generates `.github/workflows/security.yml` — runs on every PR, uploads SARIF to GitHub Security tab, posts PR comments, fails on critical/high. |
| `/agentic-security:ci --provider <name>` | Auto-detects GitLab CI / CircleCI / Buildkite / Jenkins from the repo and emits the matching template. `--provider <name>` to override. |
| `/agentic-security:ci --hooks` | Install pre-commit and pre-push git hooks that run scoped scans on every commit and full diff scans before push. Blocks on new critical findings by default. |
| `/agentic-security:ci --predeploy` | Block production deploys (`vercel --prod`, `fly deploy`, `wrangler publish`, `netlify deploy --prod`, `railway up`) when critical findings or KEV-listed deps are present. Intercepts both in Claude's Bash tool AND in the user's terminal via a sourced shell wrapper. |
| `agentic-security mcp` | Launch the MCP server (also auto-registered in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`). 12 tools: `scan_diff`, `query_taint`, `explain_finding`, `find_rule_module`, `lookup_cve`, `synthesize_fix`, `verify_fix`, `apply_fix`, `append_agents_memory`, `read_agents_memory`, `append_scratchpad`, `read_scratchpad`. Stdio JSON-RPC 2.0; hash-chained audit log; OWASP MCP top-10 hardened. |
| `agentic-security lsp` | Launch the LSP server (also auto-registered for JetBrains / Neovim / VS Code plugins). |
| `agentic-security org-scan --repos <list>` | Fleet scan across N repos with bounded concurrency. Per-repo + rolled-up JSON output. |
| `agentic-security triage list \| assign \| transition \| trend` | Per-finding state machine with MTTR + opened/closed deltas. Persists to `.agentic-security/triage.json`. |
| `/agentic-security:security-trend` | Rolling trend line: fixed vs. introduced delta across scans, sparkline, regression detection. |

#### LLM red-teaming

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/agentic-security:llm` | LLM security suite: default static scan, `--endpoint URL` for active red-team (30+ prompts x 7 mutations), `--mode jailbreak` for jailbreak families, `--mode eval` for promptfoo YAML. |

#### Adversarial review and threat modeling

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/agentic-security:threat --view adversary` | Bounded-budget LLM agent simulates a real attacker against ONE finding. Produces a hash-chained transcript showing what data was reached, what permissions obtained, what business actions performed. |
| `/agentic-security:three-agent-review` | Red team (attack) + blue team (hardening) + auditor (final verdict) for ONE finding. Composes adversary-agent with defender + auditor. |
| `/agentic-security:threat` | Auto-derived STRIDE threat model from the last scan — assets, trust boundaries, per-category finding counts, top findings per attacker objective. Use `--view model` for the same. |
| `/agentic-security:threat --view boundary` | Auto-generated Mermaid diagram of the architecture's trust boundaries — HTTP routes, queue producers/consumers, gRPC endpoints, DB edges, IaC-exposed assets — with findings rendered ON the diagram. |
| `/agentic-security:threat --view personas` | Per-attacker-persona prioritization (script kiddie / opportunistic / APT / supply-chain / insider) — what each adversary class would target first. |
| `/agentic-security:threat --view spof` | Single-point-of-failure analysis — which auth / sanitizer / rate-limit / CSRF middleware, if removed or bypassed, would expose the most high+ findings. |
| `/agentic-security:scanner --concurrency` | Missed unlocks, unguarded locks on early-return paths, fire-and-forget async, 2-lock deadlock cycles. Go / Java / JS-TS / Python. |
| `/agentic-security:scanner --spec-drift` | Functions whose names claim a behavior the body doesn't deliver (e.g., `validateOwnership()` that doesn't check user identity, `sanitize()` that doesn't escape). |
| `/agentic-security:archaeology` | Pre-incident archaeology — walk git history to answer "when did this codebase first become vulnerable to X?". For post-mortems and regulatory due-diligence. |

#### Dependency, supply chain, and posture

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/agentic-security:posture-management` | SBOM, AI-BOM, API inventory, license policy, drift, MTTR / SLA tracking. |
| `/agentic-security:compliance-report` | Auditor-ready attestation for NIST AI 600-1, OWASP ASVS, or OWASP LLM Top 10 (2025). |
| `/agentic-security:compliance-fix` | Routes every Not-Compliant control from `/compliance-report` to the agentic-security command that closes it, deduped + ordered. Flags controls that require manual / process work. |
| `/agentic-security:trim --what deps` | Find and remove packages installed but never imported. |
| `/agentic-security:supply-chain-check --show freshness` | Score how stale your direct dependencies are across all ecosystems. |
| `/agentic-security:supply-chain-check --show pinning` | Audit manifests for loose version ranges that allow silent supply-chain injection. |
| `/agentic-security:supply-chain-check --show alternatives` | Lighter-weight, more actively maintained alternatives to heavy or high-risk dependencies. |
| `/agentic-security:supply-chain-check --show install-scripts` | Every npm package's postinstall/preinstall scripts — the primary supply-chain attack vector. |
| `/agentic-security:supply-chain-check --show vendored` | Copy-pasted third-party code vendored directly into the repo — invisible to dependency scanners. |
| `/agentic-security:generate --type tests` | Generate failing security regression tests + passing fix-validation tests for each finding (Jest / Vitest / pytest). |
| `/agentic-security:status` | One-screen plugin & project health snapshot — version, last scan, finding counts, cache size, hook activation. |
| `/agentic-security:help` | Full command catalog, ICP-segmented (🎨 Vibecoder lane / 🔧 Pro lane / 🤝 Both). |

       Sideband interfaces:
         mcp/        JSON-RPC 2.0 server — 12 tools any MCP-speaking agent
                     (Claude Code / Cursor / Cline / Aider / Codex) can call.
                     Hash-chained audit log; OWASP MCP top-10 hardened.
         lsp/        Language-Server-Protocol — powers JetBrains, Neovim, and

                     PreToolUse (bodyguard + destructive-guard),
                     PostToolUse (post-edit scan), Stop (drift check).

                     -analyst, refactor-cleaner.
```

The whole engine ships as a single 2.6 MB ESM bundle (`dist/agentic-security.mjs`). Pure Node ≥ 24. No native deps. No daemon. No background process.

## What this is NOT

We try to be honest about the boundaries.

- **Not a SaaS dashboard.** It's a CLI + Claude Code plugin.
- **Not a replacement for a pentester.** Static analysis catches patterns; humans catch business-logic flaws. The `security-logic-reviewer` subagent and `/validate-findings` close part of the gap, not all of it.
- **Not magic.** It can miss novel vulnerabilities, especially anything that requires understanding intent.
- **Not free for resale.** PolyForm Internal Use license. Use it to make your own code safe and secure, Don't repackage it as a competing scanner.
