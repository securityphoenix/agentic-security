## Your AI is fast.

It's also writing security bugs.

This morning Claude wrote your login route in 9 seconds. Beautiful code. Tests pass.

It also lets anyone in the world log in as admin with a single line of curl.

You don't know this yet. Neither does Claude.

**One command finds it.**

---

## This is `/ship`.

Type it. Get one answer.

```
─────────────────────────────────────────
  ✅  Safe to deploy
─────────────────────────────────────────
```

You're done. Push it.

But if you're not safe?

```
─────────────────────────────────────────
  ❌  Not safe to deploy
─────────────────────────────────────────

  1. routes/login.ts:34
     - db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '${req.body.email}'`)
     + db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = $1', [req.body.email])

     Why: An attacker can dump your entire users table.

  Type /fix 1 to apply.
```

You type `/fix 1`. Code is patched. Run `/ship` again. Green.

That's the entire product.

---

## Two modes. One tool.

### 🎨 Easy Mode

For the vibecoder. The solo founder. The Cursor warrior. The "I just want to ship" generation.

```
/security-onboard      # 30 seconds, once
/ship                  # daily, before deploy
/fix 1                 # when /ship has notes
```

Three commands. We thought about adding more.

We didn't.

### ⚙️ Developer Mode

For the senior engineer. The platform team. The person who actually reads SARIF.

```bash
agentic-security profile set pro
agentic-security scan . --format sarif
```

Full taxonomy: CWE / CVSS / OWASP / MITRE ATT&CK. SARIF, JSON, CSV — every scan. CI gates. Slack, Jira, GitHub Security, SIEM. Audit-grade suppressions with reviewer + expiry. Triage workflow with MTTR trends. Org-wide scans across a fleet of repos. Custom rules in YAML.

## Why people stay

It runs **where you already are.** Inside Claude Code. No new tool to learn. No new tab to keep open. No surveys, no signups.

It runs **on your machine.** Your code never leaves it. No cloud. No phone-home.

It speaks **plain English.** Not "Reflected XSS via unsanitized template literal." Just: *"User input goes straight into your HTML response. Here's the fix."*

It **actually fixes things.** Most security tools tell you to "consider validation." This one writes the diff.

It's **fast.** First scan in under five seconds on most projects. Every save after that is instant.

---

## What it catches

The five things your AI assistant writes wrong, every single time:

1. **SQL injection.** User input glued into queries.
2. **Hardcoded secrets.** API keys in source — caught the moment you save.
3. **Authorization holes.** `req.body.userId` used as the "ownership check."
4. **JWT footguns.** Weak secrets, missing algorithm pinning, the `none` algorithm.
5. **Prompt injection.** User input slipped into your LLM's system prompt.

You'll never have to remember these.

---

## Install

In Claude Code:

```
/plugin install agentic-security
```

That's it. Now type `/ship`.

For CI, command line, or any project anywhere:

```bash
npx @clearcapabilities/agentic-security-scanner scan .
```

## License

Free for solo developers and teams of ≤ 10. Bigger team? Email **[ross@clearcapabilities.com](mailto:ross@clearcapabilities.com)** for a per-seat license.

Full legal terms in [LICENSE](./LICENSE). The short version: don't resell, don't reverse-engineer, otherwise enjoy.

---

## One more thing.

Every security tool you've ever used was built by security people. For security people.

This one wasn't.

This was built by people who ship code, for people who ship code. It is small, opinionated, and almost embarrassingly fast. It catches the things you'd find on a post-mortem two weeks from now — today, while the code is still on your screen.

Install it. Use it for one day.

If it doesn't change how you ship, uninstall it. Costs nothing.

If it does, tell someone.
