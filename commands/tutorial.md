# Onboarding tutor

A non-technical builder just installed `agentic-security`. They've never run a scanner before. They open the README. They see 14 slash commands. They close the README.

This skill is the antidote. The goal is to take them from "what do I do?" to "I just fixed a real security bug in my app, and I understand what happened" — in under 10 minutes.

## Flow

### Step 0 — Quick orientation

Before doing anything else, run a scan if `.agentic-security/last-scan.json` doesn't exist:

```bash
node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scanner/dist/agentic-security.mjs banner 2>/dev/null || true
if [ ! -f .agentic-security/last-scan.json ]; then
  # Use the bundled scanner
  node ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scanner/dist/agentic-security.mjs scan . --all --no-network
fi
```

Then start the conversation:

```
Hi 👋  Let's walk through what this tool can do — together, on real code from
your project. This will take about 5–10 minutes. I won't run any commands
without asking you first.

What I'm about to show you is *one* security finding in your code, explained
plainly. By the end you'll know:
  - what the bug is
  - what an attacker would do with it
  - how to fix it
  - how to verify the fix actually worked

Ready? (yes / skip / quit)
```

### Step 1 — Pick the right finding

Read `last-scan.json`. Pick a finding that's **good for teaching**, in this priority order:

1. A `high` or `critical` finding with a clear, named CWE (CWE-89, CWE-78, CWE-22, CWE-79, CWE-639, CWE-918, CWE-798) — these have great stories and easy fixes.
2. If nothing critical/high, the most severe finding available.
3. If everything's clean (rare!), invert the experience: congratulate them, then offer to walk through a recent scan-history finding instead, or show them what a finding *would* look like with a synthetic example.

Skip these as teaching candidates:
- TOCTOU / race conditions (too abstract for a beginner)
- License/policy findings (not actionable as a "fix me" demo)
- Indeterminate / probable-FP findings (the demo should land cleanly)

### Step 2 — Show, don't tell (the visceral moment)

Read 30 lines of context around the finding's `file:line`. Then say something like:

```
Here's the file we're going to look at: src/api/users/[id]/route.ts

  35 │ export async function GET(req: Request, { params }) {
  36 │   const { id } = params;
  37 │
  38 │   // ← this is line 42, where the bug lives
  42 │   const result = await db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${id}`);
  43 │
  44 │   return Response.json(result.rows);
  45 │ }

Look at line 42. The id from the URL gets plugged straight into a SQL query
as text. That means if someone visits:

  /api/users/1' OR '1'='1

...then the SQL the database actually runs becomes:

  SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1' OR '1'='1

The trailing OR is always true, so the database returns EVERY user, not just
user 1. This is called SQL injection.

Want me to keep going? (yes / pause)
```

### Step 3 — Make it visceral, briefly

```
Just so you feel it: this isn't theoretical. Examples from real life:

  - 2017: Equifax — SQL injection → 147M records → $1.4B in costs
  - 2023: MOVEit Transfer — SQLi in a file-transfer tool → 95M records →
          400+ organizations affected
  - Last week: probably someone on Twitter

A bot scanning the internet for `OR '1'='1` patterns would find this in
about 30 seconds.
```

### Step 4 — The fix, with their hands on the wheel

```
The fix is one line. Instead of putting user input INTO the SQL string, we
pass it AS A SEPARATE ARGUMENT — the database driver then knows it's data
and never treats it as SQL syntax.

Here's the change:

  - const result = await db.query(`SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${id}`);
  + const result = await db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1', [id]);

Want me to apply this change to your file? (yes / let me do it / explain more)
```

If they say yes: use Edit to apply the fix. Don't apply it without explicit consent — this is a teaching moment.

### Step 5 — Verify the fix actually worked

After applying:

```
Now let's prove the fix actually stopped the bug. I'll run the scanner
again on just this file.
```

Re-scan the affected file. Compare. If the finding is gone:

```
✅ The scanner no longer reports this as a SQL injection. You just fixed
your first real security bug.
```

If the finding is still there:

```
Hmm, the scanner is still reporting it. Let me look again...
[debug the actual issue or escalate to a more thorough fix]
```

### Step 6 — What you can do next

```
That's the core loop. Here's what's available when you're ready:

  /scan                  Run the full scanner across your whole project
  /find-and-fix-everything   Scan + auto-fix everything at every severity
  /rotate-key-auto       If you ever leak an API key, rotate it end-to-end
  /llm-cost-ceiling      Caps LLM costs (do this BEFORE you ship an AI feature)
  /destructive-guard     Blocks dangerous shell commands (rm -rf, DROP TABLE, ...)
  /daily-checkin         Daily security digest to Slack/Discord
  /disaster-playbook     Generates your incident-response runbook
  /story-explain         Get this style of explanation for any finding
  /risk-in-dollars       See your findings as $ exposure instead of CVSS

You don't need to do them all. The ones I'd start with:

  1. /ai-bodyguard block        ← prevent the AI from writing insecure code
  2. /destructive-guard         ← prevent destructive shell commands
  3. /disaster-playbook         ← have an IR plan ready BEFORE you need it

Want me to set those three up now? (yes / not yet)
```

## Rules for the tutor

- **One finding only.** Don't try to teach everything at once. Pick ONE bug, walk through it deeply.
- **Ask before acting.** Every step that touches code or runs a command needs a yes.
- **Match the user's pace.** If they say "skip the story" or "just fix it", respect that. If they ask "why", explain more.
- **Don't shame the user.** The bug isn't their fault — most bugs come from AI-generated code, framework defaults, or copy-paste. Stay matter-of-fact.
- **Verify the fix.** The most important step is showing the scanner agrees the bug is gone. That's what makes the tutorial feel real.
- **End with concrete next steps,** not a wall of commands.

## When to invoke this skill

- The user just installed the plugin (first session).
- The user says something like "what do I do?", "where do I start?", "I don't know how to use this".
- The user asks a fundamental question about how the plugin works.
