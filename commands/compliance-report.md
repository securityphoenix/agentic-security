## Frameworks

**`nist`** — NIST AI 600-1: 122 code-testable controls for GenAI systems. Writes three files: `.md` for auditors, `.csv` for spreadsheet review, `.json` for CI gating. Edit `scripts/nist-compliance/evidence-rules.json` to teach the scanner your project's vocabulary.

**`asvs`** — OWASP ASVS Level 1+2: multi-signal evidence model (manifest → import → path → code/config/doc terms, with negation filter). Edit `scripts/owasp-asvs/evidence-rules.json` to extend controls.

**`llm`** — OWASP LLM Top 10 (2025): 10 risk controls specific to LLM and Generative AI applications. Covers prompt injection, sensitive information disclosure, supply chain, data/model poisoning, improper output handling, excessive agency, system prompt leakage, vector/embedding weaknesses, misinformation, and unbounded consumption. Every Not Compliant or Partial control includes a detailed remediation checklist of concrete code changes. Aliases: `owasp-llm`, `owasp-llm-top10`, `llm-top-10`. Edit `scripts/owasp-llm-top10/evidence-rules.json` to extend the signal vocabulary for your project.

**`eu-ai-act`** — EU AI Act comprehensive mapping. 72 controls covering prohibited practices (Art. 5), high-risk system obligations (Art. 9-15 at sub-article granularity), quality management system (Art. 17), conformity assessment (Art. 43), EU database registration (Art. 49), GPAI model obligations (Art. 51-55 including copyright, training data summaries, systemic risk, energy tracking), post-market monitoring (Art. 72), and serious incident reporting (Art. 73). Annex III applicability is a legal determination — Counsel owns it, not this scanner. Edit `scripts/eu-ai-act/evidence-rules.json` to extend. **Requires Counsel + GRC sign-off before regulator use.**

This tool references standard control identifiers and uses independently authored descriptions. It does not reproduce copyrighted standard text from any standards body.

## Closing the gaps

After the report is written, the command offers `/agentic-security:compliance-fix <framework>`. That command re-scans, then routes every Not-Compliant or Partial control to the `/agentic-security:*` command that closes it — deduplicated, ordered, and tagged with which controls each step fixes. Controls that no scanner can patch (incident response plans, model evaluation policies, etc.) are listed separately with a note explaining what they require.
