VERSION
       0.35.0

SYNOPSIS
       agentic-security [--profile pro] COMMAND [ARGS] [OPTIONS]

       Claude Code slash commands (preferred interface):

       Core scanning & fixing:
       /scan [PATH] [--all|--sca|--secrets|--authz|--mcp|--pipeline|--logic|--diff]
       /fix [--one <id>] [--all [--severity]] [--pr [--apply]]
       /show-findings [--all|--kev|--chains|--threat-model]
       /validate-findings <finding-id>
       /explain <finding-id|CWE-N|vuln-name>

       Pro & vibecoder essentials (0.35.0):
       /secure [path] [--launch]
       agentic-security fix --finding <id> [--preview|--apply]
       agentic-security undo [--all|--list]
       agentic-security tickets sync --provider <github|linear|jira> [--dry-run]

       agentic-security scan --deterministic
       (auto-on) EPSS exploit-prediction enrichment via FIRST.org
       (auto-on) Blast-radius / cost framing per finding

       Auto-update behavior (0.34.2+):
              Every /scan invocation first runs an auto-update check via
              scripts/auto-update-check.js. If the throttle window
              (default: 24h) has elapsed, /scan instructs Claude Code to
              run `/plugin marketplace update agentic-security` to refresh
              the plugin to the latest version. Throttle and on/off switch
              live in .agentic-security/auto-update.json:
                {"enabled": true, "throttleHours": 24, "lastCheck": <epoch>}
              To disable entirely: {"enabled": false}.

DESCRIPTION
       agentic-security is a Claude Code plugin and standalone CLI for catching
       the security defects that AI-assisted development introduces and the
       traditional ones the AI inherits from training data. It runs locally
       (no cloud, no signup), emits SARIF + JSON + CSV every scan, and
       supports the workflow security engineers actually use: triage state,
       audit-grade suppressions, org-wide fleet scans, and custom rules.

       F1 benchmark: 100% precision and recall on 33/33 real-world and
       adversarial benchmarks (OWASP Benchmark, NodeGoat, Juice Shop, DVWA,
       LLMGoat, AIGoat, and more). Zero false positives on baseline fixtures.

       Coverage pillars:

         SAST        Taint analysis (regex + AST) for JS/TS, Java, Python.
                     25+ language-specific modules: SQL injection, XSS, command
                     injection, XXE, JNDI (Log4Shell), Java deserialization,
                     zip-slip, JWT flaws, auth provider misconfig (Clerk,
                     NextAuth, Auth0, Lucia), Supabase RLS audit, rate-limit
                     gaps, env hygiene, webhook signature verification, React
                     client-side XSS/localStorage, C/C++, C#, Go, Rust,
                     Solidity smart contracts, LLM prompt firewall.
         SCA         OSV + CISA KEV + EPSS, function-level reachability,
                     dep confusion, typosquat detection, deprecated packages
                     (npm, PyPI, Packagist, crates.io, RubyGems, pub.dev).
         Secrets     60+ credential patterns, high-entropy heuristic,
                     allowlist-aware, provider-specific rotation guidance.
         IaC         Dockerfile, docker-compose, GitHub Actions, Kubernetes.
         Deploy      Vercel, Railway, Fly.io, Netlify, Cloudflare Workers —
                     security headers, HTTPS enforcement, preview deployments,
                     health checks, compat dates.
         LLM         OWASP LLM Top 10 (2025) + prompt firewall (system prompt
                     contamination, missing max_tokens, LLM output→SQL/exec,
                     output schema validation).
         MCP         Agent-tool audit for over-privileged MCP servers.
         Pipeline    GitHub Actions: floating tags, secret echoes,
                     OIDC misconfig, write-all permissions.
         Auth/AuthZ  Broken access control, IDOR, mass assignment,
                     session fixation, JWT confusion, OAuth2 PKCE, Clerk/
                     NextAuth misconfig, dangerous email account linking.
         Container   Base-image EOL, exposed ports, runtime mode.

## SETUP

```
       agentic-security profile set pro
```

Flips the defaults: full taxonomy visible (CWE/CVSS/OWASP/MITRE/CAPEC),
confidence threshold lowered (≥0.3 vs. ≥0.9 in vibecoder mode), all
commands and flags accessible, SARIF + CSV written on every scan,
suppression schema upgraded to audit-grade.

Confirm with:

```
       agentic-security profile show
```

## COMMANDS

### Core scanning & fixing

```
       scan [PATH]
              Full SAST + SCA + secrets + IaC sweep. PATH defaults to cwd.
              Writes findings.{json,sarif,csv} to .agentic-security/.
              Also appends a snapshot to scan-history.json for /security-trend.

       fix --one <id>
              Emit the canonical patch template for one finding. The
              security-fixer subagent applies it to the affected file with
              full codebase context — detects auth library, ORM, and
              framework before writing the fix.

       fix --all [--critical|--high|--medium|--low]
              Batch-fix every finding at or above the severity tier.
              Cumulative: --high fixes critical + high. Default: --critical.

       fix --pr [--apply] [--branch <name>] [--severity critical|high|all]
              Bundle fixes into a feature branch and open a pull request.
              Default is dry-run; pass --apply to commit changes.

       triage list | assign | transition | trend
              Per-finding state machine. List by status, severity, or
              assignee. Trends compute MTTR + opened/closed deltas.

       org-scan --repos <list> [--workers N]
              Fleet scan. Workspace-aware (Nx, Turborepo, pnpm).
              Per-repo + rolled-up JSON output.

       rules validate
              Lint .agentic-security/rules.yml for schema errors, invalid
              regex, severity overrides, and disabled rules.
```

### Vibe-coder essentials (added in 0.31.0–0.32.0)

```
       stack-playbook
              Detect the project's tech stack from package.json /
              requirements.txt and output an opinionated, copy-paste-ready
              security checklist for the specific combination of frameworks
              in use. Supports: Next.js, Supabase, Stripe, Clerk, NextAuth,
              Prisma, Drizzle, OpenAI, Anthropic, LangChain, MongoDB,
              Firebase, tRPC, FastAPI, Django, and email providers.

       harden
              One-command security hardening. Applies 7 safe automated
              changes to the project:
                1. .env* entries added to .gitignore
                2. Security headers injected into next.config.js
                3. npm audit script added to package.json
                4. .env.example created from .env with placeholders
                5. Security disclosure section added to README
                6. SECURITY.md created
                7. *.pem / *.key / serviceAccountKey.json added to .gitignore
              Prints applied/skipped/failed per step. Safe to run multiple
              times (idempotent per item).

       db-audit
              Surfaces all database security findings from last-scan.json:
              Supabase service-role key exposure, NEXT_PUBLIC_ vars leaking
              service keys, auth.admin called client-side, bypassRowLevel-
              Security() in query chains, SQL tables without RLS enabled,
              raw pg Pool/Client in request handlers, and SQL injection.
              Provides remediation steps and severity breakdown.

       auth-audit
              Deep-audits the authentication layer. Covers: allowDangerous-
              EmailAccountLinking, trustHost: true (CSRF bypass), missing
              NEXTAUTH_SECRET, weak or hardcoded session secrets, hardcoded
              OAuth clientSecret, CSRF protection disabled, Clerk sensitive
              paths in publicRoutes, session cookies without secure/sameSite,
              JWT alg:none, algorithm confusion, JWT without expiry.

       rate-limit-check
              Find API endpoints missing rate limiting by category:
                auth    — login/register/forgot/verify (brute-force risk)
                ai      — generation/chat/inference (cost explosion risk)
                payment — stripe/checkout/pay (card-testing risk)
                contact — forms/newsletter/waitlist (spam risk)
              Prints copy-paste @upstash/ratelimit setup for serverless
              and express-rate-limit for Node servers.

       webhook-audit
              Audit webhook handlers for missing cryptographic signature
              verification. Detects provider (Stripe, GitHub, Clerk, Svix,
              Resend, Twilio) from imports and URL patterns. Fires only when
              ALL signals are present: webhook path + body read + no verify.
              Explains the fake-payment attack vector and provides provider-
              specific fix snippets including raw-body parser requirements.

       env-check
              Runtime + scan-based environment hygiene report:
                • .env* files absent from .gitignore
                • .env* files tracked in git (git ls-files check)
                • NEXT_PUBLIC_*SECRET/KEY/TOKEN vars in env files
                • .env.example / .env.sample with real-looking values
                • process.env.X || "real-fallback" in source code
                • dotenv loaded in non-entry files

       rotate-secret [value]
              Given a secret value or finding ID, detects the provider
              (OpenAI, Anthropic, Stripe, GitHub, AWS, Supabase, Slack,
              SendGrid, Resend, Twilio) from the key prefix/pattern. Lists
              every file referencing the secret. Provides platform-specific
              rotation steps (Vercel / Railway / Fly / Render / Netlify).
              Ends with post-rotation verification checklist and git-history
              purge advice.

       deploy-check
              Platform-specific infra security audit. Detects platform from
              config files and checks:
                Vercel   — security headers in vercel.json / next.config.js,
                           public preview deployments
                Railway  — health check configuration
                Fly.io   — force_https, auto_stop_machines
                Netlify  — security headers in netlify.toml
                Cloudflare Workers — compatibility_date in wrangler.toml
              Provides copy-paste remediation for each platform.

       attack-surface
              Gathers scan statistics (severity counts, KEV deps, attack
              chains, unauth state routes) and instructs Claude to synthesise
              a plain-English threat narrative — 3–5 realistic attack
              scenarios with attacker steps, impact, likelihood, and
              single-line fix per scenario. Written for builders, not
              security engineers.

       prompt-firewall
              Surfaces all LLM/AI security findings:
                • User input concatenated into system prompts (prompt
                  injection via system prompt contamination)
                • Missing max_tokens cap (cost explosion / DoS)
                • LLM output used as SQL/shell/eval input (second-order
                  injection — critical severity)
                • LLM response consumed without schema validation
              Gate: all rules require an LLM API import to fire (zero
              impact on non-AI codebases).

       csp-cors
              Reads package.json for external services (Supabase, Stripe,
              Clerk, OpenAI, analytics, Sentry, Intercom) and instructs
              Claude to generate exact Content-Security-Policy and CORS
              config for the detected framework and deployment platform.
              Outputs ready-to-paste header blocks for Next.js, Express,
              and Vercel JSON.

       security-tests [--finding <id>|--all|--critical]
              Detects the project's test framework (Vitest, Jest, pytest,
              Node test runner) and instructs Claude to generate per-finding
              test files with:
                • A failing test proving the vulnerability is exploitable
                • A passing test proving the fix works
              Uses real imports from the affected file, not mocks. Outputs
              as security/<slug>-security.test.{js|ts|py}.

       ci-gate [--severity critical|high|medium] [--comment] [--apply]
              Generates .github/workflows/security.yml that:
                • Runs on pull_request and push to main
                • Uploads SARIF to GitHub Security tab
                • Posts a PR review comment with finding counts and
                  top findings (with --comment)
                • Fails the build on findings at --severity threshold
              Default threshold: high. Pass --apply to write the file.

       cve-alerts [--slack <url>|--discord <url>] [--apply]
              Generates:
                • scripts/cve-monitor.mjs — checks OSV for new CVEs
                  across all installed packages, tracks seen IDs in
                  .agentic-security/cve-alert-state.json, posts to
                  Slack/Discord webhook when new CVEs drop
                • .github/workflows/cve-alerts.yml — daily 8am UTC cron
              Pass --apply to write the files. Set CVE_ALERT_URL secret
              in GitHub Actions for notifications.

       vault-wizard [doppler|infisical|vercel|railway]
              Inventories all env vars across .env*, classifies them as
              sensitive (SECRET/KEY/TOKEN/PASSWORD patterns) vs. config,
              and instructs Claude to generate a step-by-step migration
              guide to the specified vault including CLI commands, CI
              integration snippets, and post-migration cleanup instructions.
              Auto-detects platform if target not specified.

       security-trend
              Reads .agentic-security/scan-history.json (appended by every
              scan) and renders:
                • Bar-chart sparkline of total findings over time
                • Fixed vs. introduced delta between last two scans
                • Net change with colour coding (green=improving)
                • List of newly introduced finding IDs
              Each /scan --all run automatically appends a snapshot.

       security-badge
              Computes letter grade (A–F) from last-scan.json and generates:
                • Shields.io badge Markdown for README
                • Professional security posture paragraph for investor
                  due-diligence questionnaires or pitch decks
```

### Pro & vibecoder essentials (added in 0.35.0)

```
       secure [PATH] [--launch] [--json] [--run]
              Smart router. Inspects project state and prints the single
              best next action — no menu, no choice paralysis. Decision
              tree:
                no prior scan        → run `scan .`
                criticals open       → `fix --finding <id> --preview`
                highs open           → `/show-findings`
                mediums only         → `/report-card`
                last scan > 7 days   → re-scan
                clean                → `/security-badge`
                --launch + criticals → BLOCK
                --launch + clean     → `/launch-check`
              --run auto-executes the recommended `agentic-security ...`
              command. --json emits the decision as a struct for piping.

       fix --finding <id> --preview | --apply
              --preview shows a unified diff (3 lines of context) of the
              proposed change without writing. --apply writes the change
              and stores the original under .agentic-security/fix-history/
              with a log entry in fix-history/log.json. Both modes require
              a mechanical replacement (f.fix.replacement or
              f.fix.replaceLine) — for free-form fixes use the
              security-fixer subagent which produces a replacement first.

       undo [--all|--list]
              Revert the most recent un-reverted fix from history.
              --all reverts every applied fix in reverse order.
              --list prints the fix history with applied/reverted state.
              Atomic per-fix backups; safer than `git stash` for
              partial-rollback scenarios.

       tickets sync --provider <github|linear|jira> [--severity high]
                    [--repo OWNER/REPO] [--team-id ID] [--dry-run]
              Two-way sync between findings and ticket systems:
                • Creates a ticket for every open finding ≥ severity
                  that does not already have one tracked in
                  .agentic-security/tickets.json.
                • Closes tickets whose findings are no longer present.
              GitHub uses the gh CLI (no extra auth). Linear needs
              LINEAR_API_KEY + --team-id. Jira needs JIRA_BASE_URL,
              JIRA_EMAIL, JIRA_TOKEN, JIRA_PROJECT_KEY env vars.
              Idempotent: re-running is a no-op once everything matches.
              tickets list             — print all tracked tickets

       rules lock
              Compute the current rule-pack content hash (union of every
              named pack's CWE set) and write rules.lock.json with the
              scanner version. Required for --deterministic. Re-run
              after upgrading agentic-security to refresh the lock.

       rule list | rule test <fixture-glob>
              Custom pattern-rule DSL — Semgrep-lite. Rules live in
              .agentic-security/rules/*.yml. Schema:
                id: my-org/no-eval
                title: "Use of eval() is forbidden"
                severity: high
                cwe: CWE-95
                languages: [javascript, typescript]
                match:
                  pattern: "\\beval\\s*\\("
                  notMatch: "// safe-eval-allowed"
                  # OR allOf: [regex1, regex2] within `window: 50` lines
                message: "eval() bypasses static-analysis controls."
              The `rule test` harness runs every rule against every file
              in the glob and prints PASS / FAIL (false positive) /
              FAIL (missed). Files containing 'vulnerable' in the path
              are expected to fire; 'clean' files are expected not to.

       scan --pr [REF]
              Diff-aware mode: only scan files changed since REF.
              Without an explicit ref, auto-detects the PR base from
              GITHUB_BASE_REF / CI_MERGE_REQUEST_TARGET_BRANCH_NAME /
              BUILDKITE_PULL_REQUEST_BASE_BRANCH /
              BITBUCKET_PR_DESTINATION_BRANCH; falls back to origin/main.
              Uses the existing --changed-since plumbing under the hood.

       scan --deterministic
              Reproducible mode for audits, baselines, and CI:
                • Verifies .agentic-security/rules.lock.json matches
                  the current scanner version + rule-pack hash.
                • Forces --no-network (no OSV / EPSS network calls).
                • Stable-sorts every findings array by file → line →
                  vuln → id.
                • Zeros out scanId / startedAt / durationMs so the JSON
                  output is byte-identical for the same input.
              Exits 4 with a diff if the lockfile doesn't match.

       (auto-on) EPSS exploit-prediction enrichment
              Every CVE-bearing finding decorated with epssScore +
              epssPercentile from FIRST.org. Cached under
              ~/.claude/agentic-security/epss-cache/ for 24h.
              Findings with percentile ≥ 0.95 get tags: ["exploited-now"]
              and a one-tier severity bump (medium→high→critical) so
              they sort to the top. Disable with --no-epss.

       (auto-on) Blast-radius / cost framing
              Every finding stamped with a blastRadius object:
                scope: 'paying-users'|'all-users'|'admin-only'|'public'
                dataAtRisk: ['PII','payment','auth-tokens',...]
                userCount: <estimated>
                dollarLow / dollarHigh: cost band (severity-multiplied)
                narrative: plain-English one-liner for vibecoders /
                           exec reporting
              Heuristic-driven from project signals (Stripe usage, auth
              library, user/PII schema, .env present). No LLM call, no
              network. Disable with --no-blast-radius.
```

### Real-time bodyguards (added in 0.34.0)

```
       ai-bodyguard [on|off|warn|block|status]
              PreToolUse hook on Edit / Write / MultiEdit. Scans the
              content the agent is about to write BEFORE it hits disk.
              High-precision rules with near-zero FP rate:
                • SQL injection via string concatenation
                • exec()/spawn()/os.system() with template strings
                • NEXT_PUBLIC_*SECRET / NEXT_PUBLIC_*API_KEY (browser leak)
                • Hardcoded sk-/ghp_/xoxb-/AKIA/pk_live_ credentials
                • dangerouslySetInnerHTML without sanitize
                • eval()/new Function() on user input
                • jwt.decode() instead of jwt.verify()
                • Supabase service_role key in client-side code
                • LLM messages.create() without max_tokens
                • CORS '*' + Allow-Credentials: true
              Config: .agentic-security/bodyguard.json
                {"mode": "warn"|"block"|"off", "skipPaths": [...]}
              Block mode returns exit 2 + stderr msg (Claude Code denial
              signal). Warn mode prints to stderr but allows the edit.

       destructive-guard [on|off|warn|block|status]
              PreToolUse hook on Bash. Pauses on commands vibe-coders
              most often regret. 13 critical/high patterns:
                CRITICAL:  rm -rf on parent dirs, rm -rf with no target,
                           DROP TABLE / DROP DATABASE / TRUNCATE,
                           supabase db reset, git push --force to main,
                           git push --force any branch, aws s3 rm --recursive
                HIGH:      git reset --hard, git clean -fdx, vercel --prod,
                           curl|bash, chmod 777, docker system prune -a
              Config: .agentic-security/destructive-guard.json
                {"mode": "block"|"warn"|"off", "extraPatterns": [{...}]}
              Add custom patterns: each entry {name, re, severity, why,
              instead}. Override per-command with AS_GATE_OVERRIDE=1.

       predeploy-gate [install|check|status|off]
              Two-layer block on prod deploys:
                • PreToolUse Bash hook (catches direct prod commands
                  inside Claude Code)
                • Shell wrapper functions sourced from
                  scripts/predeploy-gate.sh (intercepts in the user's
                  own terminal: vercel, fly, flyctl, wrangler, netlify,
                  railway)
              Gate checks:
                1. last-scan.json exists
                2. Scan is no older than require_recent_scan_hours
                3. Zero findings at block_on severities (default critical)
                4. Zero KEV-listed dependencies (when block_on_kev: true)
              Config: .agentic-security/predeploy-gate.json
                {"block_on": ["critical"], "block_on_kev": true,
                 "require_recent_scan_hours": 24}
              Bypass once: AS_GATE_OVERRIDE=1 <command>
```

### Active rotation & cost control (added in 0.34.0)

```
       rotate-key-auto <value> | --scan [--yes]
              ACTIVELY rotate a leaked credential end-to-end.
              Provider detection by prefix:
                openai                sk-...,  sk-proj-...
                anthropic             sk-ant-...
                stripe                sk_live_..., rk_live_...
                aws                   AKIA[A-Z0-9]{16}
                github                ghp_..., github_pat_...
                supabase-service-role JWT with role=service_role
                slack                 xoxb-/xoxa-/xoxp-...
                google-api            AIza...
              For each detected provider:
                1. Print exact revoke commands (console URL + CLI)
                2. Print blast-radius warning (Stripe = real money,
                   AWS = crypto-mining, Supabase service-role = RLS bypass)
                3. Prompt for new value (or read from --new-value)
                4. Scrub leaked value across all text files
                   (with backups in .agentic-security/rotation-backups/)
                5. Push new value to detected deploy platforms:
                   vercel env / fly secrets / railway variables /
                   wrangler secret / netlify env:set
                6. Print final audit checklist (billing dashboard,
                   git history grep, history rewrite caveat)
              --scan walks the repo, finds all leaked keys, rotates each.
              --yes skips confirmation prompts (CI / non-interactive).

       llm-cost-ceiling [--apply] [--generate-middleware]
                        [--generate-tracker --daily-cap-dollars N]
              Audit every LLM call site, enforce cost ceilings.
              Detected SDKs (by file ext + pattern):
                JS/TS:  anthropic.messages.create,
                        openai.chat.completions.create,
                        openai.completions.create (legacy)
                Python: client.messages.create (Anthropic),
                        client.chat.completions.create (OpenAI)
              Recognized cap keys: max_tokens, max_completion_tokens
              (OpenAI o1/o3), max_output_tokens (Gemini).
              --apply        Auto-patch missing max_tokens (default: 1024).
                             JS/TS: injects as first prop in object literal.
                             Python: injects as first kwarg.
                             Conservative — leaves complex call shapes alone.
              --generate-middleware
                             Writes drop-in rate-limit middleware tailored
                             to detected framework:
                               next → middleware/llm-rate-limit.ts
                               express/fastify → middleware/llm-rate-limit.ts
                               python → middleware/llm_rate_limit.py
                             Defaults: 20 calls / IP / 60s window.
              --generate-tracker --daily-cap-dollars N
                             Writes lib/llm-spend-tracker.ts:
                               trackAndGate({dailyCapUsd, model,
                                             inputTokens, outputTokens})
                             Throws SpendCeilingExceeded once cap is hit.
                             Pricing table for Claude/GPT-4o models is
                             baked-in; override per project.
              Exit 1 if any uncapped calls remain — suitable for CI gate.
```

### Translate the jargon (added in 0.34.0)

```
       risk-in-dollars [--top N] [--json]
              Translate each finding's CWE into best-/likely-/worst-case
              dollar exposure. Sourced from public incident settlements
              (Capital One $190M for SSRF, T-Mobile $350M for IDOR, Equifax
              $1.4B for SQLi, etc.). 19 CWE classes mapped with named
              scenarios + specific regulatory triggers (GDPR Art. 33,
              CCPA, HIPAA, NIST AI 600-1, EU AI Act).
              Default sort: worst-case descending.
              Data source: scripts/data/dollar-risk-bands.json (editable).

       story-explain <finding-id> | --random | --worst
              Narrative-form explanation instead of CWE jargon. 4-act
              structure:
                Setup           — what the app does, where the bug lives
                Meet <Name>     — attacker persona matched to vuln class
                The attack      — minute-by-minute, present tense, concrete
                                  URLs and payloads (not "an attacker would")
                The aftermath   — customer ticket, regulator clock, $ cost
                What stops this — the literal 2–3 line code fix
              Attacker personas mapped to vuln classes (SQLi → competitor
              doing recon; IDOR → curious user; hardcoded key → bot; ...).

       daily-checkin [--setup|--slack <url>|--discord <url>|--webhook <url>]
                     [--crontab|--rescan|--project-name NAME]
              Post a daily security digest to messaging tools.
              Digest shape:
                Open counts (critical/high/medium)
                New findings since last digest (with file:line, top 5)
                Resolved finding count
                KEV (known-exploited) package count
              State in .agentic-security/daily-checkin-last.json —
              fingerprints from last run drive the new/resolved diff.
              Renderers: plain text, Slack Block Kit, Discord embeds,
              generic JSON. --crontab prints suggested cron line.
              --rescan forces a fresh scan before building the digest
              (otherwise reads last-scan.json).
```

### Customer-facing artifacts (added in 0.34.0)

```
       security-onepager [--company NAME] [--contact EMAIL]
                         [--output PATH] [--print]
              Customer-facing "How we keep your data safe" markdown.
              Auto-derived sections:
                Posture summary  Live counts + traffic-light state +
                                 clean-scan streak from streak.json
                Stack            Detected frameworks
                Practices        Conditional — only includes practices
                                 the scan output actually evidences
                                 (Supabase RLS audit only if Supabase
                                 detected, Stripe webhook integrity
                                 only if Stripe detected, etc.)

              -o SECURITY.pdf --pdf-engine=xelatex`.

       privacy-docs [--company NAME] [--contact EMAIL]
                    [--jurisdiction EU|US-CA|UK|OTHER]
                    [--generate-banner]
              Detect every third-party data processor and generate a
              tailored PRIVACY.md. 14 providers mapped:
                Stripe, Supabase, Clerk, Auth0, Sentry, PostHog,
                Mixpanel, GA4, OpenAI, Anthropic, Vercel Analytics,
                Cloudflare Analytics, Resend, SendGrid.
              Each processor entry includes:
                Purpose, exact data received, DPA URL, sub-processors URL,
                cookies set (if any), category (auth/payment/analytics/ai)
              Jurisdiction adds the appropriate rights clause (GDPR/UK
              GDPR/CCPA/generic). --generate-banner writes a React
              cookie-consent component to components/CookieBanner.tsx
              with localStorage persistence + analyticsConsent event.

       trust-page --contact <email> [--pgp <url>] [--canonical-url <url>]
              Generates three artifacts:
                1. public/.well-known/security.txt
                   RFC 9116 compliant. Contact, Expires (1y), Preferred-
                   Languages, optional Encryption (PGP), Canonical, Policy.
                2. public/security-posture.json
                   Live snapshot (counts, streak, last-scan) consumed by
                   the page below at build time.
                3. /security page tailored to framework:
                   Next.js App Router → app/security/page.tsx
                   Next.js Pages Router → src/pages/security.tsx
                   Vanilla → public/security/index.html
              Page shows traffic-light state, critical/high/medium counts,
              clean-streak days, last-scan time, practices block, and the
              disclosure contact channel.
              Re-run periodically — security.txt has a 1-year expiry.
```

### Resilience & onboarding (added in 0.34.0)

```
       disaster-playbook [--stack supabase,stripe,vercel,...]
                         [--output PATH] [--print]
              Generate a stack-specific incident-response runbook

       tutorial
              First-run walkthrough that picks ONE real finding from the
              user's project, explains it in plain English, walks them
              through fixing it with consent at every step, then
              verifies the fix actually worked.
              Flow:
                0. Orient. Run a scan if none exists.
                1. Pick a teachable finding (high/critical with named
                   CWE in {89,78,22,79,639,918,798}; skip TOCTOU /
                   license / indeterminate)
                2. Show ±15 lines of context around the finding
                3. Show 2-line attacker timeline + real-world incident
                4. Show the fix with consent prompt
                5. Re-scan affected file, confirm finding is gone
                6. Suggest next 3 commands by name
              Rules: ONE finding only, ask before acting, match user's
              pace, no shaming, end with concrete next steps.
```

### Dependency & supply chain

```
       trim-dependencies [PATH] [--dry-run] [--include-dev]
              Find installed packages never imported in source code.
              Reports per-package on-disk size and transitive dep count.
              Default is --dry-run; pass --apply to execute removals.

       dep-freshness
              Score how stale direct dependencies are across all ecosystems.
              Stale deps are the primary CVE accumulation vector.

       dep-pinning
              Audit manifests for loose version ranges that allow silent
              supply-chain injection. Flags unpinned deps and missing
              lockfiles.

       dep-alternatives
              Find heavy or high-risk dependencies with lighter-weight,
              native, or more actively maintained alternatives.

       install-script-audit
              Audit every npm package (direct and transitive) for
              postinstall/preinstall scripts — the primary supply-chain
              attack vector in the npm ecosystem.

       vendor-audit
              Find copy-pasted or bundled third-party code vendored directly
              into the repo — invisible to dependency scanners and never
              receiving security updates.

       digest --slack <url> | --discord <url>
              POST a structured digest payload to a Slack/Discord webhook.

       profile show | set | detect
              Persona master switch. detect uses heuristic signals
              (SECURITY.md, CI workflow named *security*, etc.).

       packs list
              List available rule packs (owasp-top-10, cwe-top-25,
              llm-security, supply-chain).
```

## HOOKS

The plugin ships three runtime hooks that the Claude Code harness invokes
automatically. Registered via `hooks/hooks.json`:

```
       SessionStart
              hooks/session-welcome.js
              Prints the welcome banner with last-scan summary.

       PreToolUse  (matcher: Edit|Write|MultiEdit)
              hooks/pre-edit-bodyguard.js   [added 0.34.0]
              Scans the proposed content BEFORE write. Exits 2 to deny
              (block mode + critical pattern) or 0 with stderr message
              (warn mode). Reads .agentic-security/bodyguard.json. ~10ms.

       PreToolUse  (matcher: Bash)
              hooks/pre-bash-guard.js       [added 0.34.0]
              Intercepts destructive shell commands before they run.
              Critical patterns return exit 2 (deny); high patterns
              return exit 0 with stderr warning. Reads
              .agentic-security/destructive-guard.json. ~5ms.

       PostToolUse  (matcher: Edit|Write|MultiEdit)
              hooks/post-edit-scan.js
              Scans the directory of the edited file, surfaces NEW high/
              critical findings. Throttled per-file ≤1/5s.
```

All hooks read JSON event payloads on stdin per the Claude Code hook
contract, are stdlib-only (no `node_modules` dependency at the hook
level), and degrade silently if their config file is missing.

To disable a hook without uninstalling the plugin:

```json
{
  "mode": "off"
}
```

Written to the relevant `.agentic-security/<hook>.json` file.

---

## EXIT STATUS

```
       0   Clean — no findings at or above --severity
       1   Findings at low or medium severity
       2   Findings at high severity
       3   Findings at critical severity
       4   Engine error (parse failure, IO, malformed config)
```

CI gating example — blocks the pipeline on any critical finding:

```bash
       agentic-security scan . --severity critical
```

Or use the generated workflow from `/ci-gate --apply`.

---

## FINDINGS SCHEMA

Every finding produced by the scanner includes:

```json
{
  "id":          "module:RULE_ID:file/path.js:42",
  "title":       "Human-readable title",
  "vuln":        "Canonical vulnerability name (used for F1 family mapping)",
  "severity":    "critical | high | medium | low | info",
  "file":        "relative/path/to/file.js",
  "line":        42,
  "description": "What the vulnerability is and how it is exploited",
  "remediation": "Exact fix, often with code snippet",
  "cwe":         "CWE-89",
  "kev":         false,
  "toxicityScore": 0–100,
  "triageScore":   0–100
}
```

Severity values in order: `critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`, `info`.

---

## SUPPRESSIONS

Suppressions are structured, reviewed, and auditable. Stored in
`.agentic-security/suppressions.yml`:

```yaml
       - finding_id: c14d...
         file: lib/admin.js
         line: 47
         cwe: CWE-798
         rule_version: 0.34.0
         reason: |
           Hardcoded credential is in a test fixture, not a production
           code path. Verified via call-graph analysis (no production
           caller).
         justification_signed_by: alice@team.example.com
         reviewer: bob@team.example.com
         reviewed_at: 2026-05-13T14:30:00Z
         expires_at: 2026-11-13T00:00:00Z
         ticket: SEC-1247
```

Validation rules:
- signer must differ from reviewer (two-person rule)
- expires_at must be in the future
- critical-severity findings cannot be suppressed without `--accept-critical`
- rule_version is pinned: a newer scanner re-surfaces the finding unless
  the suppression is re-approved

Lint with:

```
       agentic-security rules validate
```

Inline per-line suppression (source code):

```js
       const key = "hardcoded"; // agentic-security-ignore: hardcoded-secret
```

---

## TRIAGE

State machine: `open` → `in-progress` → (`fixed` | `wont-fix` | `false-positive`).
Findings auto-transition to `fixed` when the scanner no longer detects them.

```
       agentic-security triage list --status open --severity critical
       agentic-security triage assign SEC-0042 alice@team
       agentic-security triage transition SEC-0042 in-progress
       agentic-security triage transition SEC-0042 fixed \
              --comment "Patched in PR #94"
       agentic-security triage trend --since 30
```

`trend` output:

```
       Opened:  47
       Closed:  52
       Net:     -5 (improving)
       Open:    critical=2 high=8 medium=15 low=4
       MTTR median: 3.2 days
```

State is persisted to `.agentic-security/triage.json`.

---

## CUSTOM RULES

`.agentic-security/rules.yml`:

```yaml
       version: 0.34.0

       severityOverrides:
         "Hardcoded Credential Check": medium

       disable:
         - "Verify x-powered-by Header is Disabled"

       custom:
         - id: internal-auth-bypass
           regex: 'if\s*\(\s*request\.headers\[\s*[''"]x-internal-bypass[''"]'
           vuln: "Internal Auth Bypass Header"
           severity: critical
           cwe: CWE-287
           description: "x-internal-bypass is debug-only. Never in prod."
           fix: "Remove the x-internal-bypass header check."
```

### Pattern-rule DSL — `.agentic-security/rules/*.yml` (added in 0.35.0)

Standalone, Semgrep-lite rules that produce findings directly without dataflow modeling. Each YAML file in `.agentic-security/rules/` defines one or more rules:

```yaml
       id: my-org/no-eval
       title: "Use of eval() is forbidden"
       severity: high
       cwe: CWE-95
       languages: [javascript, typescript]   # or [any] / [python] / [go] / ...
       match:
         pattern: "\\beval\\s*\\("            # single regex (gm flags)
         # OR allOf: [regex1, regex2, ...]    # all must match within `window` lines
         # window: 50                          # default 50 lines
         # notMatch: "// safe-eval-allowed"   # kill switch
       message: "eval() bypasses our static-analysis controls."
       remediation: "Use JSON.parse for data; use a sandboxed VM for code."
```

Test fixture pairs (`vulnerable/foo.js` + `clean/foo.js`):

```
       agentic-security rule list
       agentic-security rule test "test/fixtures/**/*.js"
```

The harness reports `PASS` when a rule fires on `vulnerable/`, `FAIL (false positive)` when it fires on `clean/`, and `FAIL (missed)` when it doesn't fire on `vulnerable/`.

### Rule-pack lockfile — `.agentic-security/rules.lock.json` (added in 0.35.0)

```
       agentic-security rules lock
       # → wrote .agentic-security/rules.lock.json
       #   scanner: 0.35.0  rulePackHash: 40669df8f5856e18

       agentic-security scan --deterministic
       # Verifies the lockfile, refuses to run on mismatch.
```

Required for audit-defensible scans (compliance reports, regression baselines, byte-stable CI artifacts).

---

## INTEGRATIONS

Configuration in `.agentic-security/integrations.yml` (gitignored).

```
       Jira / ServiceNow
              Body builders produce issue payloads; pipe to your
              existing client.

       GitHub Security tab / GitLab
              SARIF auto-written every scan. Upload via
              github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3.
              Use /ci-gate --apply to generate a full workflow.

       Slack / Discord
              Webhook digest with critical/high/medium counts +
              top 3 findings. Use /cve-alerts for daily CVE push alerts.

       SIEM (Splunk / Datadog / Elastic)
              One JSON event per finding, with source_attribution and
              rule_version for correlation.

       Two-way ticket sync (added in 0.35.0)
              agentic-security tickets sync --provider github|linear|jira
              Creates issues for new findings, closes them when findings
              drop. Idempotent state in .agentic-security/tickets.json.
              GitHub uses the `gh` CLI (no extra auth).
              Linear needs LINEAR_API_KEY + --team-id.
              Jira needs JIRA_BASE_URL, JIRA_EMAIL, JIRA_TOKEN,
              JIRA_PROJECT_KEY.
              --dry-run plans without writing.
              `agentic-security tickets list` prints all tracked tickets.
```

---

## CI/CD

Auto-generated GitHub Actions workflow (recommended):

```
       /ci-gate --apply --severity high --comment
```

Manual CI runner (auto-detects PR base ref):

```bash
       npx @clearcapabilities/agentic-security-scanner ci . --fail-on critical
```

Raw scan with SARIF upload to GitHub Security tab:

```yaml
       - uses: actions/checkout@v4
       - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
         with: { node-version: '20' }
       - run: |
           npx @clearcapabilities/agentic-security-scanner scan . \
             --format sarif --output security.sarif
       - uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
         with: { sarif_file: security.sarif }
```

Pre-commit framework hook (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`):

```yaml
       - repo: https://github.com/Clear-Capabilities/agentic-security
         rev: v0.34.0
         hooks:
           - id: agentic-security
```

Runs `agentic-security ci --baseline HEAD --fail-on high` against
staged changes and blocks the commit on any high or critical finding.

Rule packs for focused scans:

```bash
       agentic-security scan --pack owasp-top-10 .
       agentic-security scan --pack cwe-top-25 .
       agentic-security scan --pack llm-security .

# TUTORIAL

The following exercises walk through the tool from first scan to auditor-ready
compliance evidence. Work through them in order; each exercise builds on the
state left by the previous one.

---

## Exercise 1 — First scan

**Goal:** run a full scan, understand the output, and know what files were
written.

```
/scan --all
```

Or from the CLI:

```bash
agentic-security scan .
```

**What to look for:**

- The one-line verdict at the top: `SAFE TO DEPLOY` (green) or `NOT SAFE` (red).
- The severity breakdown: `critical=N high=N medium=N low=N`.
- The three output files written to `.agentic-security/`:
  - `findings.json` — full machine-readable results
  - `findings.sarif` — for GitHub / GitLab Security tabs
  - `findings.csv` — for spreadsheet or executive review
  - `scan-history.json` — automatically appended for `/security-trend`

**Checkpoint:** open `.agentic-security/findings.json` and confirm it has a
`findings` array. Note one finding ID — you'll use it in Exercise 3.

---

## Exercise 2 — Focused scans

Each pillar can be run independently.

**Dependency CVE audit only:**

```
/scan --sca
```

Backed by OSV.dev. Look for `kev: true` entries — these are on the CISA Known
Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog and should be treated as P0.

**Secrets sweep:**

```
/scan --secrets
```

Covers 60+ provider patterns (AWS, GCP, GitHub, Stripe, etc.) and high-entropy
heuristics. Any hit: rotate immediately with `/rotate-secret`, move to a secrets
manager with `/vault-wizard`, audit git history with `git log -S <value>`.

**Auth/AuthZ deep audit:**

```
/scan --authz
/auth-audit
```

The `--authz` flag covers JWT algorithm confusion, hardcoded JWT secrets, missing
`algorithms:[]`, OAuth2 PKCE, redirect_uri validation, session fixation, and
multi-tenant queries. `/auth-audit` surfaces provider-specific misconfigurations
(Clerk, NextAuth, Auth0, Lucia, Better Auth).

**Database security:**

```
/db-audit
```

Supabase-aware: RLS disabled, service-role key exposed client-side, admin API
in browser code, bypassed row-level security, raw pg connections in handlers.

**AI/LLM app security:**

```
/scan --logic
/prompt-firewall
```

`--logic` invokes the business-logic reviewer. `/prompt-firewall` surfaces
LLM-specific risks: system prompt contamination, missing max_tokens, model
output used as SQL/exec input (second-order injection), no output validation.

**MCP server audit:**

```
/scan --mcp
```

Reads `claude_desktop_config.json`, `.mcp.json`, `mcp_servers.json`. Flags
untrusted install vectors, hardcoded API keys, filesystem servers with broad
access, dangerous capability names.

**GitHub Actions pipeline audit:**

```
/scan --pipeline
```

Finds floating tags (`@latest`, `@main`), secret echoes, `write-all`
permissions, OIDC misconfigurations, `github.event.*` script injection.

**Platform infrastructure:**

```
/deploy-check
```

Checks your actual deployment config files: Vercel headers, Railway health
checks, Fly.io HTTPS, Netlify headers, Cloudflare Workers compat date.

**Diff review (before merging a branch):**

```
/scan --diff
/scan --diff --since main
```

Scores the git diff by architectural risk. Risk levels:
- `critical` — auth removed, new shell call → run `/validate-findings` + `/fix --one`
- `high` → run `/validate-findings`
- `medium`/`low`/`none` → safe to merge

---

## Exercise 3 — Understand a finding

Use the finding ID you noted in Exercise 1.

```
/explain <finding-id>
```

You can also explain by CWE or by name fragment:

```
/explain CWE-89
/explain SQL Injection
```

The output is a plain-English card with four sections:
1. What this means
2. How an attacker abuses it
3. Worst case if not fixed
4. How to fix it

**Advanced:** compare the plain-English explanation to the raw finding fields:

```bash
jq '.findings[] | select(.id == "<your-id>")' .agentic-security/findings.json
```

Fields to understand: `cwe`, `toxicityScore`, `kev`, `owaspCategory`.

---

## Exercise 4 — Validate a finding (optional)

Before applying a fix, confirm the finding is real.

```
/validate-findings <finding-id>
```

The PoC generator reads the affected file, constructs a concrete exploit payload,
and emits a Playwright regression test. If it cannot construct a payload it emits
`PROBABLE_FP` — use this to suppress false positives with justification.

---

## Exercise 5 — Apply fixes

Apply a fix to a single finding:

```
/fix --one <finding-id>
```

The security-fixer agent reads the affected file, its imports, the auth
middleware, the ORM/DB helpers it calls, and the route registration — then
applies the fix in the idiom of your specific stack (not a generic template).

Batch-fix all critical and high findings:

```
/fix --all --high
```

Bundle all fixes into a pull request (dry-run by default):

```
/fix --pr --severity high --apply
```

---

## Exercise 6 — Security trend

Run a second scan after applying fixes, then view the trend:

```
/scan --all
/security-trend
```

The trend view shows a sparkline bar chart, the number of findings introduced
vs. fixed, and a net delta. Green = improving, red = regressing.

---

## Exercise 7 — Harden the project

Apply safe automated infrastructure improvements:

```
/harden
```

Then review the changes:

```bash
git diff
```

The command prints what it applied, what it skipped (already configured), and
what failed. Review before committing.

---

## Exercise 8 — Stack-specific playbook

Get a checklist tailored to your exact stack:

```
/stack-playbook
```

For a Next.js + Supabase + Stripe app, this surfaces ~30 opinionated items
specific to how those three systems interact — not generic OWASP advice.

---

## Exercise 9 — Set up CI security gate

Generate and apply a GitHub Actions workflow:

```
/ci-gate --apply --severity high --comment
```

This creates `.github/workflows/security.yml`. Push it, open a PR, and the
scanner runs automatically — failing the build if critical/high findings are
introduced and posting a review comment with the summary.

---

## Exercise 10 — Generate compliance evidence

```
/compliance-report nist
```

Outputs an auditor-ready mapping of scan findings to NIST AI 600-1 controls.
Also available: `/compliance-report asvs` (OWASP ASVS Level 1+2) and
`/compliance-report llm` (OWASP LLM Top 10). Use `/security-badge` to
generate the investor-ready paragraph and README badge.

---

## Exercise 11 — Set up CVE monitoring

```
/cve-alerts --slack https://hooks.slack.com/... --apply
```

Creates `scripts/cve-monitor.mjs` and `.github/workflows/cve-alerts.yml`.
Add `CVE_ALERT_URL` as a GitHub Actions secret, enable the workflow, and
your team gets notified at 8am UTC whenever a new CVE drops for any of your
installed packages.

---

## Exercise 12 — Turn on the real-time bodyguards

The 0.34.0 hooks give you protection at the moment code is written or
commands are run — distinct from the post-edit scanner. Two hooks, both
configurable:

```
/ai-bodyguard warn          # try in warn mode first (default)
/destructive-guard block    # default — blocks rm -rf, force-push to main, etc.
```

After running each, the relevant `.agentic-security/<hook>.json` is
written. Verify by trying a known-bad operation in Claude Code:

- For `/ai-bodyguard`: ask Claude to "write a Next.js route that takes a
  user id from the URL and returns SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${id}".
  In warn mode you'll see a stderr explanation. In block mode the edit
  is refused with exit 2.
- For `/destructive-guard`: ask Claude to run `rm -rf /` or
  `DROP TABLE users`. The hook blocks the call with a plain-English
  reason + the safer alternative.

When you're confident, escalate `/ai-bodyguard` from `warn` → `block`.

---

## Exercise 13 — Cap your LLM costs

Critical before you ship any AI feature.

```
/llm-cost-ceiling                         # audit
/llm-cost-ceiling --apply                 # auto-patch missing max_tokens
/llm-cost-ceiling --generate-middleware   # rate-limit per IP per minute
/llm-cost-ceiling --generate-tracker --daily-cap-dollars 50
```

Each step is a separate decision. Review with `git diff` before
committing the patches.

---

## Exercise 14 — Generate the customer-facing trust artifacts

When an enterprise prospect asks "are you secure?" you want three
artifacts ready:

```
/trust-page --contact security@myapp.com --canonical-url https://myapp.com
/security-onepager --company "My App Inc." --contact security@myapp.com
/privacy-docs --jurisdiction US-CA --generate-banner
```

After these run, you have:

- `public/.well-known/security.txt` — the file every infosec team checks
- `app/security/page.tsx` (or vanilla HTML) — your live-posture trust page
- `SECURITY.md` — sales-ready one-pager
- `PRIVACY.md` — privacy policy tailored to your actual data processors
- `components/CookieBanner.tsx` — React consent banner matched to your
  analytics

Convert SECURITY.md to PDF for sales emails:

```bash
pandoc SECURITY.md -o SECURITY.pdf --pdf-engine=xelatex
```

---

## Exercise 15 — Have a disaster plan BEFORE you need one

```
/disaster-playbook
```

Writes `DISASTER.md` with stack-specific incident-response commands.
Bookmark it. Re-run when your stack changes (the runbook is generated,
not authored — it goes stale fast).

---

## Exercise 16 — Block accidental prod deploys

```
/predeploy-gate install
```

Default config: blocks on any critical finding OR any KEV-listed
dependency OR if last scan is older than 24h. Tighten by setting
`block_on: ["critical", "high"]` in `.agentic-security/predeploy-gate.json`.

In your terminal, source the shell wrapper for protection outside Claude
Code:

```bash
echo 'source ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/predeploy-gate.sh' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Verify:

```bash
vercel deploy --prod
# 🚦  agentic-security pre-deploy gate
#     ✅  Safe to deploy. Proceeding...
```

Bypass once: `AS_GATE_OVERRIDE=1 vercel deploy --prod`.

---

## Exercise 17 — Wire up the daily check-in

```
/daily-checkin --setup
```

Interactive prompt for Slack/Discord webhooks. Then add to your crontab
or GitHub Actions schedule (see `/daily-checkin --crontab` for the line).

The digest shows what changed since yesterday — not just today's totals.
State persists in `.agentic-security/daily-checkin-last.json`.

---

## SAST MODULE REFERENCE

## F1 BENCHMARK

The scanner is evaluated against structured ground-truth benchmarks. Every
rule ships with a `vulnerable/` + `clean/` fixture pair in `test/fixtures/`.

Local benchmark suite (33 fixture scenarios):

```bash
cd scanner && npm run bench
```

Real-world benchmark (requires internet — clones external repos):

```bash
npm run bench:realworld              # all apps
npm run bench:realworld -- --app nodegoat
npm run bench:realworld -- --app juice-shop
```

LLM/AI adversarial suite:

```bash
npm run bench:llm-goats
```

Current scores:

| Mode                       | Local fixture suite | Real-world benchmarks                               |
|----------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Wildcard-relaxed (default) | F1 100.0%           | F1 100% on 33/33 apps (family-level coverage)       |
| Strict line-level (`--no-wildcards`) | F1 100.0%  | See per-app breakdown below                          |

Strict-line breakdown on real-world benchmarks (after 0.34.5 GT curation):

```
30 apps at F1 100%   snyk-goof, nodegoat, juice-shop, railsgoat, trufflehog-fixtures,
                     gitleaks-fixtures, owasp-mastg-mobile, issueblot-dotnet, bandit-test,
                     dvwa, pygoat, cfngoat, terragoat, hadolint-fixtures,
                     damn-vulnerable-defi, ethernaut, openzeppelin-contracts,
                     owasp-dotnet, ossf-cve-benchmark, gai-risk-management,
                     django-clean, flask-clean, rails-clean, gin-gonic-gin,
                     expressjs-express, gitea-polyglot, linux-kernel-perf,
                     igoat-swift, + 2 more.
laravel-clean      F1 98.7%   (recall gap from matchAny-collapsed Composer.json entries)
snyk-rust-vuln-apps F1 90.6%  (recall gap from matchAny-collapsed Cargo.toml entries)
owasp-benchmark    F1 80.0%   (engine-bound on Java flow patterns — planned tree-sitter)
sard-juliet-java   F1 25.6%   (engine recall gap on Java SAST patterns)
juliet-c-cpp       quarantined (no C/C++ GT builder yet — wildcards-only)
```

See `scanner/test/benchmark/STRICT-F1-BASELINE.md` for the full methodology
notes, why each gap exists, and the engineering roadmap to raise it.

Run the strict mode yourself:

```bash
cd scanner
node test/benchmark/realworld/bench-realworld.js --all --no-wildcards
node test/benchmark/realworld/bench-realworld.js --app owasp-benchmark --no-wildcards
```

F1 safety rules for new rules:
1. Gate on at least 2 signals before firing (never single-regex)
2. Include `_NONPROD_RE` to exclude test/fixture/spec paths
3. New `vuln` strings must either (a) not fire on benchmark apps or (b)
   be added to the relevant app's `wildcardFamilies` in expected JSON
   (with a `_doc` field explaining why family-level scoring is appropriate)
4. Verify with `npm run bench` AND `--no-wildcards` after adding any rule
5. If strict-F1 regresses on any app, either fix the rule or add line-level
   expected entries documenting the new finding
