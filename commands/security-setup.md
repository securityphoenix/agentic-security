Install project-level command shortcuts for agentic-security so the short forms work in this project.

```bash
mkdir -p .claude/commands

# Locate the installed plugin bundle
BUNDLE=""
for f in ~/.claude/plugins/cache/clearcapabilities/agentic-security/*/scanner/dist/agentic-security.mjs; do
  [ -f "$f" ] && BUNDLE="$f"
done
if [ -z "$BUNDLE" ]; then
  echo "ERROR: agentic-security plugin bundle not found. Ensure the plugin is installed."
  exit 1

---
description: Apply a remediation patch for a single finding from the last scan.
argument-hint: "<finding-id>"
---
\`\`\`bash
node $BUNDLE fix --finding \${1}
\`\`\`
Hand the finding off to the security-fixer subagent: read the affected file, apply the fix template adapted to the surrounding code, and run the project's test command if one is configured. Do not declare the fix complete until the finding no longer reproduces on re-scan.
CMDEOF

cat > .claude/commands/fix-all.md << CMDEOF
---
description: Remediate every finding at or above a severity threshold (default critical).
argument-hint: "[--severity critical|high|medium]"
---
Read \`.agentic-security/last-scan.json\`. For every finding whose severity is at or above \`\${1:-critical}\`, dispatch the security-fixer subagent in sequence (not in parallel — each fix may invalidate later findings). After each batch, re-run \`/security-scan\` to confirm fixes landed. Stop and report if a fix's tests fail.

The audit fires on \`.mcp.json\`, \`claude_desktop_config.json\`, and \`mcp_servers.json\` files. Rerun after adding any new MCP server.
